Allow to cool and then place in a bowl. Process the fresh fish in a food processor to make a rough purée. Add the crabmeat, egg, herbs, mustard and 100g\/3½oz of the breadcrumbs. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if necessary. Roll the crabmeat mixture into balls just a little larger than a golf ball and dip in the remaining breadcrumbs.  Finally form the balls into little cakes by pressing them down lightly. Melt one tablespoon of the butter in a large frying pan with the vegetable oil. Saute the crabcakes over a moderate heat until nicely golden and heated right through. This will take about 3-4 minutes on each side (depending on thickness)  Drain on kitchen paper and serve with a garlic mayonnaise. To make the mayonnaise, combine the egg yolks, garlic, one tablespoon of the lemon juice, the lemon zest and the salt in a food processor.  Blend for a few seconds and then slowly add the oils in a steady stream until emulsified.  Taste and adjust the amount of lemon juice and salt if necessary. Serve with the crabcakes and some green salad leaves.
