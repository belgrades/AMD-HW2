Fry the lamb, in batches, for 3-4 minutes or until browned all over. Remove the lamb and set aside. Fry the onion in the tagine for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and spices, and cook for a further 3-4 minutes.  Return the cooked lamb cubes to the tagine, then add the stock, dried apricots and chopped tomatoes.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and bring the mixture to the boil.  Reduce the heat, cover with the tagine lid and simmer for 45 minutes, checking occasionally, until the lamb is tender and the sauce has thickened. (Add a little more stock if the mixture starts to dry out.) Stir in the chickpeas and cook for a further 15 minutes. To serve, sprinkle over the parsley, mint and flaked almonds. Serve the couscous and Greek-style yoghurt alongside.
