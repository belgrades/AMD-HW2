Soak the tamarind pod in the wine to allow it to soften and dissolve slightly. Place the beef into a clean bowl along with the following ten ingredients from the ingredients list. Knead the meat and spices together thoroughly - don't be shy, get stuck in.  Add the tamarind and red wine mixture, then add the cream, 125g\/4oz butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Roll the bay leaves up and 'plant' them like seedlings in the meatloaf.  Butter the sides and bottom of an earthenware pot large enough to hold the meat with plenty of room to spare. Sprinkle the inside with the cumin seeds. Place the meatloaf into the preheated oven for about one hour, until slightly risen and cooked through. For the custard topping, whisk together the milk and the eggs. Add the curry powder, salt to taste and whisk again.  Remove the meatloaf from the oven and carefully pour the custard mixture over the top. Return it to the oven and bake until the custard topping has set and cooked to a golden brown colour. You can finish it off with a blowtorch if it looks a bit anaemic. Finish with a flourish of freshly grated nutmeg.
