For the steak and Brie sandwich, rub the oil onto the steak slices and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Heat an ovenproof griddle pan over a high heat, add the steak halves and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side. Place the Brie on top of one of the steak slices, then place the other steak on top, creating a sandwich. Transfer the pan to the oven for 5-6 minutes, then remove the steak from the pan to rest.  For the toasted sweetcorn, heat one tablespoon of the oil in the same pan over a medium heat and cook the carrots for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to the oven and roast for 5-6 minutes, or until coloured slightly. Remove from the oven and set aside. In a separate pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil over a medium heat and fry the corn kernels for 3-4 minutes, or until they start to colour. Add the peas and chilli flakes, stir well, then add the white wine vinegar and the sugar, and stir again.  Slice two of the baby carrots and add these to the pan, then add the chopped fresh herbs and stir well.  To serve, spoon the toasted sweetcorn, peas and carrots onto a serving plate, and place the steak and Brie 'sandwich' on top. Serve the remaining whole roasted carrots on the side.
