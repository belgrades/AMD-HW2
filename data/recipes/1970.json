{"recipe_name":"Chicken stuffed with leek, basil and ginger with crisp fried cabbage","author":"Paul Rankin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the stuffed chicken breast, remove the mini-fillet from the underside of the chicken breast and set aside. Cut a slit horizontally through the length of the chicken breast to make a pocket inside the breast. Blanch the sliced leeks in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes, or until softened and then drain. In a bowl, finely chop the reserved chicken mini-fillet and place into a bowl. Mash slightly with a fork to make a paste, then stir in the blanched leeks, basil, ginger, double cream, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the mixture into the pocket in the chicken breast and pull the flesh over to seal the filling inside. Roll the chicken in the sesame seeds. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chicken and fry on all sides until golden-brown. Wrap the chicken in aluminium foil, place in the oven and bake for ten minutes, or until completely cooked through. Set aside, in a warm place, to rest for five minutes and then slice into four pieces. For the creamy leek sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, add the leeks and fry gently for three minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and curry powder and fry for one minute. Add the wine and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Add the cream, salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. For the crisp fried cabbage, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Carefully place the shredded cabbage into the hot oil and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and then sprinkle with the sugar and salt. To serve, spoon the creamy leek sauce onto a serving plate, top with the stuffed chicken breast and place a pile of crisp fried seaweed on top. Garnish with a quartered plum tomato.
