Fry the bacon lardons until crisp. Remove the lardons using a slotted spoon and set aside. In same pan, fry the onions and garlic for 5-6 minutes, or until golden-brown and softened.

Divide the mixture between four individual pie dishes. Cut the pastry into four pieces, each big enough to cover the pie dish. Brush the edge of each dish with egg wash and cover with the pastry.
