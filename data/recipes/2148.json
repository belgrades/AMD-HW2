Roll teaspoonfuls of dough into balls and place on the lined baking tray at least 2.5cm\/1in apart. Flatten slightly with the back of spoon. Bake the biscuits for 10 minutes. Allow to cool for a minute on the tray, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, melt the three types of chocolate separately in a microwave (at least a minute).

Dip the cooled biscuits halfway into one type of chocolate, then allow the excess to run off before placing on a sheet of baking parchment to set.
