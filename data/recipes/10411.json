{"recipe_name":"Tielle sétoise (squid and tomato pie)","author":"Stephane Reynaud","programme":"Saturday Kitchen Best Bites","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 3","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pastry, combine the flour and salt on a work surface add the butter and work the dough with your fingertips until the mixture has a texture like sand or resembles breadcrumbs. Make a well in the mixture, place the egg yolks and water in the centre and mix using one hand starting from the centre of the well.  Bring the dough together into a smooth ball.  Let it rest in the refrigerator, covered in plastic wrap, for 30 minutes before using. (It will keep in the refrigerator for one week covered in plastic wrap.) In a heavy-based frying pan, gently fry the squid, celery, onion and garlic in three quarters of the olive oil for 2-3 minutes without colouring the squid. Add the white wine, tomatoes, black olives and sugar. Cook over a low heat for one hour (the mixture needs to stew together well). Allow to cool and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Combine the paprika with the remaining olive oil and set aside. Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking paper. From the pastry roll out two circles about 20cm\/8in wide and about 3mm\/1\/8 inch thick. Put one piece of pastry on the prepared tray. Spread the squid mixture over the pastry, leaving a 1cm\/½in border all around. Glaze the edges with the egg yolk. Cover with the second piece of pastry and seal the two rounds of pastry dough together by pinching the edges, and then roll them inward so they stick together. Brush the tielle with the paprika oil and bake for 30 minutes. For the fennel and mint salad, place the sliced fennel and mint leaves in a bowl. Put the lemon zest and juice in a small glass bowl along with the oil and whisk. Pour the dressing over the fennel and mint and mix together. To serve, place the tielle sétoise on a serving board and pile the salad next to it.
