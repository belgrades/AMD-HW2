Remove the steaks and set aside on a plate. In the same pan, add the garlic, anchovies, capers and half of the parsley and fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and oregano and cook for one minute over a high heat, stirring well. Lower the heat and return the steaks and any juices collected on the plate to the pan and stir to make sure they are covered with the sauce. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the steaks are tender and cooked to your liking. For the couscous, place the couscous into a bowl and pour over enough boiling water to cover by 1cm\/Â½in. Stir well then cover with cling film and leave for 3-5 minutes. Remove the cling film and stir well with a fork. Add the remaining couscous ingredients and mix well. To serve, spoon equal amounts of couscous onto each plate. Place a steak onto each portion of couscous and spoon the sauce over.
