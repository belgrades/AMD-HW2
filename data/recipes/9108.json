In a large bowl, mix together the two types of flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Add the buttermilk and mix until a sticky dough forms. Lightly flour a work surface and tip the dough onto it.  Gently roll and fold the dough a couple of times to bring the mixture together. Do not knead.  Shape the dough into a ball. Flatten the ball gently with your hand.
