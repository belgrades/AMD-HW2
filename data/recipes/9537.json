Grease a pudding bowl or oven-proof dish with butter and spoon in the sponge mix. Cover with cling film and microwave on full power for eight minutes. To make the custard, place the cream, milk, vanilla seeds and split pod in a small saucepan. Bring to simmering point and set aside to infuse. In a large bowl whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Remove the vanilla pod from the warm cream and milk mix and discard. Whisk the warm milk and cream mix into the egg and sugar. Pour this mix back into the saucepan. Stir continuously, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. To make the fruit syrup, place the berry juices, caster sugar and red wine into a small saucepan over a high heat. Bring the boil and reduce for two minutes, until thickened. To serve, turn the sponge onto a plate, drizzle with custard and spoon over some syrup.
