For the soya bean mash, blanch the beans in boiling water until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Drain the beans and transfer to a food processor. Add the watercress, mint and boiling water and pulse until the beans are mashed but not entirely smooth. For the balsamic tomatoes, place the tomatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle over the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with salt and place in the oven to roast for 10-15 minutes. To serve, place a bed of the soya bean mash on a serving plate and spoon the marinated fried tofu over the top.
