Kid’s job: Mix the water and flour together. Kids can mix using one finger so that they don’t get a whole hand covered in dough. Doughy hands can be cleaned by rubbing a little more flour onto the hands over another bowl or the bin - resist the urge to wash doughy hands as you will block the drain! Kid’s job: Add the oil and knead the dough - you are aiming for a soft dough. If it is too sticky add a little more flour, if it is too dry add a splash of water.  Kid’s job: Knead the dough for five minutes - kids can do this in the bowl or on a clean surface using one or two hands. You can cook the breads straight away or leave the dough to stand for about half an hour. This is a good time to make a quick filling such as a grated salad or dip. Kid’s job: Divide the dough into four balls, or six if you have a smaller frying pan. Kid’s job: On a clean surface, roll each ball of dough one at a time using a rolling pin. If you pick up and move round the flatbread often you know it hasn’t stuck. (You may need to sprinkle a little flour on the surface but only use a little - too much will dry out the dough.) Don’t worry if they aren’t perfect circles! Adult’s job: Heat a large frying pan. Take a sheet of kitchen paper and rub a little oil onto the surface of the pan. Cook each flatbread for about two minutes on one side - it should puff up a little. Adult’s job: Flip the flatbread over using tongs and then cook for a couple of minutes on the other side. The flatbread should have turned lighter in colour and may have a few spots of brown.   Keep the cooked flatbreads warm, wrapped in foil or a clean tea towel, until the others are cooked. If you want crisp flatbreads you can now rub them with a little olive oil, chop into strips or triangles with scissors and then ask an adult to bake them for 5-10 minutes, or until crisp.
