It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and sauté the garlic, chilli and chicken.  Add the peppers, beans and coriander and stir together for a further minute. Add the lime juice and remove from the heat. Divide the mixture between the two tortilla wraps, then roll up like a spring roll and secure with toothpicks. Deep fry the tortillas for two minutes until golden, then remove carefully with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels. Cut on the diagonal. To serve, place the parsley on a large plate, add the tortillas and garnish with the lime wedges and a sprinkle of paprika.
