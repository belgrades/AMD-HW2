Roughly chop the walnuts and figs then add to a food processor along with the sour cherries, the cranberries and half the pumpkin seeds. Add a spoonful of ground almonds and blitz together - but not for long - leaving nice sizable chunks of the nuts and fruit. Tip into a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the whole pumpkin seeds.  In a pan melt the butter with the sugar and golden syrup, trying not to stir it too much and allowing it to melt together gradually. Once melted mix in the oats and the fruit and nuts and spread the mixture out evenly in an oven tray then bake for 25 minutes. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over simmering water. When the flapjacks are baked, cut them into small rectangles and dip them as far as you dare into the melted chocolate. Allow to chill for 20 minutes in the fridge and then serve.
