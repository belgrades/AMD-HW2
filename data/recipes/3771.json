Pour the chicken and its marinade onto a baking tray and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. For the salad, heat a large saucepan of salted water and blanch the broccoli for 2 minutes, remove and drain. Heat a large griddle pan and drizzle the broccoli with the oil. Place on the griddle pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until charred. Combine the mushrooms, onion, olives and cooked broccoli in a large bowl.
