Put the peppers, courgettes and onion on a large baking tray and drizzle with oil. Season with salt and pepper and toss everything together until the vegetables are lightly coated. Roast for 20 minutes until softened and lightly charred. Pat dry the fish on kitchen paper and check for any bones. Remove any that you see with tweezers. Season the fish with black pepper and wrap each fillet loosely with a slice of ham. Remove the tray and make gaps for the fish. Place the fish on the tray. Mix the breadcrumbs with the Parmesan and parsley and scatter over the fish and vegetables. Bake for another 12–15 minutes or until the fish is cooked, the ham has crisped and the breadcrumbs are lightly browned. Meanwhile, to cook the spinach, heat a medium sauté pan and add the butter. Once melted add the spinach and cook for a minute or so until wilted. Serve the cod hot, drizzled with a little balsamic vinegar, on a bed of wilted spinach.
