{"recipe_name":"Rice bowl with ginger, radish and avocado","author":"Nigella Lawson","programme":"Simply Nigella","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/food\/ic\/food_16x9_608\/recipes\/rice_bowl_with_ginger_58307_16x9.jpg","method":"Put the rice and 1 cup (250ml\/9fl oz) cold water in a heavy-based saucepan that comes with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to the boil. Once it’s bubbling, clamp on the lid, turn the heat down very low and simmer for 25 minutes. Then turn off the heat, leaving the lid on, and let it stand for a further 5 minutes, by which time the rice will be cooked – but still nutty – and the water absorbed. While the rice is cooking, use a vegetable peeler to shave the ginger into very thin strips.  When the rice is cooked, spoon into a mixing bowl. Add the tamari or soy sauce and the cider vinegar to the bowl and toss with a fork to combine, and then do the same with the ginger shavings, radishes and seeds. Stir all but a little of the chopped coriander into the rice, still using a fork. Divide between 2 smallish bowls and top with avocado, cut either into gondola shaped slices or chunks, as wished. Sprinkle each with the remaining coriander, and eat serenely.
