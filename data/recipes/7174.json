Wrap each piece of meat in two slices of Parma ham and set aside.  Re-heat the pan and add the garlic, mustard, wine, stock, lemon juice, sage, salt and pepper to taste. Reduce by half. Put the pork back in the pan and cook gently for about 10 minutes, until the meat is cooked through.  For the coleslaw, simply mix all the ingredients together, season to taste, cover and chill until needed.  For the apples, brush the apple slices with olive oil, sprinkle with sugar and salt. Grill or griddle until golden brown on both sides. To assemble the dish, place a portion of coleslaw on the centre of the plate, top with the pork and apple slices.
