Put it into a bowl, cover with cling film and leave for a few minutes. Remove the black skin from the pepper, scoop out the seeds and chop the flesh. Heat a grill pan to medium-hot. Rub the sourdough with half the oil and the garlic and grill on both sides until browned. Set aside. In a bowl, mix the spring onions, parsley and chilli. Toss in the Romano peppers. Preheat the grill to high. Spread the remaining oil on a baking tray. Add the sardines, season with salt and pepper and grill on one side for 1 minute, or until cooked.  For the slaw, place the vinegar, water and sugar in a saucepan and heat until the sugar has dissolved. Mix the other slaw ingredients in a large bowl. Just before serving pour over the liquid and add the coriander. To serve, garnish on the bread with the pepper mix, add the sardines and finish with a touch more garnish and a squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately with the slaw.
