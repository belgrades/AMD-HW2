Place the asparagus onto the griddle pan and cook, turning occasionally until charred all over. Place the bacon under the grill and cook, turning once, until crisp. For the dressing, place the lemon juice, tarragon and vinegar into a non-reactive pan over a low heat until warm. Remove the tarragon sprig. Place the egg yolks into a bowl and lightly whisk. Add the lemon and vinegar mixture and continue whisking. Whisking constantly, gradually add the clarified butter, whisking to emulsify and create a loose mayonnaise consistency. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, place three spears of asparagus onto each plate and season, to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
