{"recipe_name":"Honey and ginger-glazed ribs with pak choi tempura and mango salsa","author":"James Tanner","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the ribs, place the ribs into a small saucepan and cover with boiling water. Add the rosemary, thyme and unpeeled garlic clove and bring to the boil. Boil for ten minutes, then drain and discard the water and herbs. For the glaze, place the sesame oil, honey, ginger, soy sauce, orange juice and chilli into a small pan and simmer for five minutes, or until reduced and sticky. Place the blanched ribs onto a baking sheet and brush with the glaze. Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the pork is completely cooked through. Place the ribs onto a serving plate, pour over any remaining glaze and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Meanwhile, for the pak choi tempura, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the ice and flour into a large bowl and gradually whisk in the sparkling water to make a batter the consistency of double cream. Dip the pak choi into the batter to coat, shaking off any excess, then carefully place into the hot oil. Deep fry for 4-5 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the mango salsa, place all of the mango salsa ingredients into a small bowl and stir to combine. To serve, place the pak choi tempura onto the plate with the ribs. Sprinkle over the coriander and serve the mango salsa in a bowl alongside.
