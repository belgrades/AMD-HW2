For the pastry, put the flour, breadcrumbs, suet, orange zest and sugar in a large bowl and mix together lightly. Pour the orange juice into a jug and add enough cold water to make it up to 200ml\/7fl oz.   Pour the liquid onto the suet mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Knead very lightly on floured surface for a few seconds until very soft and pliable. Break off roughly two thirds of the dough and form into a ball. Roll out a circle of 5mm\/¼in thickness. Use the dough to line the inside of the basin, leaving the excess overhanging the sides. Keep the remaining third of the dough for the lid. Sprinkle two tablespoons of the sugar into the lined basin and dot with a 4-5 cubes of butter. Cover with two of the lemon slices. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, adding a little extra to each layer as the basin becomes wider. Roll out the reserved pastry on a lightly floured surface. Brush with water and place over on top of the pudding. Press the pastry edges together firmly to seal the pastry onto the pudding basin. Trim any excess pastry. Cover with pleated greaseproof paper and aluminium foil. Tie the pudding tightly around the rim with a long piece of string.  Place on a trivet or upturned saucer in a very large saucepan and add enough just-boiled water to rise halfway up the sides of the basin. Cover and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 3 ½ hours, topping up the water when necessary. Remove the basin carefully from the water and stand for three minutes. Remove the string, foil and paper. Loosen the sides of the pudding with a round-bladed knife. Invert the pudding onto a plate (The pudding will look slightly sunk on the top and the pastry should be golden.) Serve with lashings of double cream or ice cream.
