Add the egg white and blend for 20 seconds. Add half the cream gradually, blending all the time, until you have a smooth mousse. Put in a bowl and place over ice. Mix in the remaining cream, cayenne, lemon zest and herbs. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Flatten the sole fillets slightly. Score the flesh side several times using a sharp knife. Season and spread the mousse all over, then roll up and secure with toothpicks. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Preheat the oven to 160C\/140C Fan\/Gas 3.  Put the fish rolls in an ovenproof pan with the stock, wine and shallot. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover with a lid or buttered greaseproof paper. Bake for 7–8 minutes, remove and leave to rest in a warm place for 4–5 minutes. For the sauce, strain the cooking liquid into a clean pan and cook over a high heat until reduced to a sauce consistency. Add the double cream and gradually whisk in the butter. Stir in the herbs and lemon juice to taste. Keep warm.  Heat a knob of butter in a frying pan. When foaming, add the mushrooms and cook quickly, then drain.  Divide the sole fillets between warm plates, scatter over the mushrooms and spoon over the sauce. Top with the watercress and serve.
