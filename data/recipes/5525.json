Brush the salmon with marmalade and olive oil, then roll in the toasted sesame seeds to coat well. Leave to cool and then, with a very sharp knife, slice the salmon thinly. For the crushed new potatoes, place the cooked potatoes into a bowl, add the rest of the crushed new potatoes ingredients and crush roughly with the back of a fork. For the dressing, place the dressing ingredients into a small bowl and whisk to combine. To serve, place the crushed new potatoes onto a serving plate. Arrange the salmon slices alongside and drizzle with the dressing.
