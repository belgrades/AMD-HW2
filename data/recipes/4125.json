Season the pork chops with salt and freshly ground black pepper then rub with a little of the olive oil. Heat a griddle pan until hot, add the pork chops and cook on each side until golden brown then transfer the griddle pan to the oven and cook for 5 minutes until the pork is just cooked through. Remove the pork from the oven and set aside to rest for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter and cabbage and stir fry for 2-3 minutes until just tender. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside until needed. For the cauliflower cheese, preheat oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then add the cauliflower florets and cook for two minutes. Drain and place the cauliflower in a buttered oven-proof dish. Place the butter and flour into a saucepan and heat to melt the butter. Cook, stirring for one to two minutes until lightly golden-brown. Remove the pan from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk to form a smooth sauce. Return the sauce to the heat and simmer for two to three minutes. Remove from the heat and beat in the egg yolks, mustard and Worcestershire sauce and half the cheese. Season with salt and pepper then pour over the cauliflower and top with the remaining cheese. Place the cauliflower cheese under the grill and cook until golden-brown.  To serve, place a spoonful of cabbage into the centre of the plate then place the pork chop on top. Spoon the cauliflower cheese alongside.
