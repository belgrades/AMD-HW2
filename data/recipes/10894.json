Cover the bowl with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least two hours, or overnight if possible. When you’re ready to prepare the meal, add the dipping sauce ingredients to a small pan over a medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Taste and adjust the flavours as necessary – adding a little more sugar if it’s too sour, or more rice vinegar or lime juice if too sweet. Set aside. For the wraps, mix the carrots, beansprouts and chilli in a bowl. Pour over the rice vinegar, mix well and set aside while you cook the steaks. In a large heavy-based frying pan, heat a dash of oil.  Shake off any excess marinade from the steaks and cook for 2-3 minutes on either side - depending on their thickness and how rare you like your steak. Remove and rest on a plate for five minutes. Add the mint and coriander to the carrot mixture and mix to combine.  To serve, arrange the Little Gem leaves on a serving plate. Slice the rested steak, tipping any resting juices over the carrot mixture. Fill the lettuce leaves with spoonfuls of the carrot mixture. Top each leaf with a slice of steak and serve with the dipping sauce and lime wedges on the side.
