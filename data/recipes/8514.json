Add the chicken, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until pale golden-brown on both sides. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Heat the remaining oil in the frying pan the chicken was cooked in and fry the onion, garlic and chilli for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the tomatoes and cook for a further 2-3 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to break down. Return the seared chicken to the tomato stew and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)  To serve, stir in the lime juice and herbs and spoon onto a serving plate. Sprinkle over the chives and garnish with the lemon wedges.
