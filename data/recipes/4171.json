Rub the lamb with olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and place the lamb, thyme, rosemary and garlic onto the griddle. Griddle the lamb for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Set aside and leave to rest for five minutes. For the fondant potatoes, heat the butter in a frying pan, add the potatoes and a splash of water and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook over a low heat, turning occasionally, for 12-14 minutes, or until golden-brown and tender. For the slow-roasted tomatoes, heat a griddle pan, place the halved tomatoes cut-side down in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn over, sprinkle over the oil, thyme and garlic and cook over a low heat for five minutes. To serve, place the lamb in the middle of a serving plate with the fondant potatoes and tomatoes.
