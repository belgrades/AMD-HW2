Heat the butter until just melted.  Split the vanilla pods and scrape out the seeds, reserving the pod. Place the sugar and flour into a bowl then add the vanilla seeds, honey and eggs then whisk in the melted butter until you have a nice smooth batter. Spoon the batter into the tins, only half filling each indent. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden-brown. (Depending on the size of the madeleines, small ones may take only 8-10 minutes.) Mix the ground cinnamon and sugar for dusting on a plate, then roll the madeleines quickly in the sugar to coat them thoroughly. For the winter caramel sauce, heat the sugar in a pan until it turns a light golden-brown. Pour in half the cream and bring to the boil, stirring well. Add the star anise, cinnamon, reserved vanilla pod and butter and the rest of the cream. Cook for 2-3 minutes until thickened and smooth. Strain through a fine sieve into a serving bowl. Serve the madeleines with the sauce. They can be kept in an airtight container for up to a week.
