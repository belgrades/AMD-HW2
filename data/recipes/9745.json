Place the sugar into a small frying pan over a high heat. As it begins to melt and caramelise add the pecans.  Once the caramel is a deep amber colour, pour the mixture out onto the baking sheet and place in a cool area to allow to set. Once brittle, place onto a chopping board and finely chop. To make the sticky toffee pudding, melt the butter in a wide saucepan over a medium heat. Add the double cream and maple syrup, bring to a simmer and simmer for five minutes. To serve, place the ginger cake in a warm bowl, pour over the toffee sauce and garnish with the praline pieces.
