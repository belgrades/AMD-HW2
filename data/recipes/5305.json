Add the chopped onions to the casserole the beef was cooked in. Fry in the pan juices for 1-2 minutes, or until softened.  Stir in the potatoes and swede and continue to cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped leeks, carrots and bay leaves and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
