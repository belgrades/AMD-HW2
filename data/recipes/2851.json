Chill in the fridge for 24 hours. The next day, put all the dry ingredients in a large plastic food bag and mix. Remove the rabbit from the buttermilk, put it in the bag with the seasoned flour and shake to coat. Heat a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 165C, or until a piece of bread turns golden-brown when dropped in the oil. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the rabbit until golden-brown and cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper to drain. For the sweetcorn salsa, blend all the ingredients, except the caster sugar and sweetcorn, to a smooth purée in a food processor. Heat the sugar in a heavy-based saucepan over a low-medium heat until it melts and forms a golden-brown caramel. Do not stir and keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t burn. Once the sugar has caramelised, pour in the puréed mixture and stir well. Bring the mixture to the boil and add the sweetcorn. Reduce the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until sticky and jam-like. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. For the mustard slaw, first make a mayonnaise. Put the egg yolks, white wine vinegar and a teaspoon of mustard into a food processor and blend until pale and creamy.  With the motor running, add the oil, in a thin steady stream, until the mayonnaise is thick (you may not need all the oil). Add the remaining mustard and stir. Put the cabbage, carrot and onion in a large bowl and stir in the mayonnaise. Just before serving add the parsley and mix. To serve, place the deep-fried rabbit on serving plates alongside the slaw. Serve the sweetcorn salsa in a little pot alongside.
