Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until combined.  Beat in the egg and vanilla extract, a little at a time, until well combined. Stir in the flour until the mixture comes together as a dough. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of 1cm\/½in. Using Halloween-style biscuit cutters, cut biscuits out of the dough and carefully place onto the baking tray. Bake the biscuits for 8-10 minutes, or until pale golden-brown. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then cool on a wire rack.  For the icing, sift the icing sugar into a large mixing bowl and stir in enough water to create a smooth mixture. Stir in the food colouring.  Carefully spread the icing onto the biscuits using a knife and set aside until the icing hardens.
