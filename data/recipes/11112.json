Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Place both flours, baking powder, salt, cheddar and half the parmesan into a large bowl and mix to combine.  Add the milk and bring the ingredients together with your hands or a wooden spoon.  The mixture will be sticky at this point. Tip the mixture onto a lightly floured surface. Fold and knead to form a soft dough.  Flatten or lightly roll the dough to 2.5cm\/1in thick.  Dredge a 6cm\/2½in cutter in flour to ensure a precise cut and cut out 15 scones.
