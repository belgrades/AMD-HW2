Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the carrots, heat the olive oil in a ovenproof frying pan and add the carrots. Sprinkle over the cumin and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown. Transfer to the oven and roast for 10-12 minutes, or until tender. Remove from the oven, stir in the lime juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the kebabs, mix all the kebab ingredients together in a bowl until well combined. Thread the lamb onto the skewers, place onto a baking tray and roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes (for medium), or until cooked to your liking. Turn the kebabs occasionally to ensure that they are golden-brown on all sides. Serve the lamb kebabs on a serving plate with the roasted carrots alongside.
