Heat a griddle pan, add the chicken breast and griddle for 4-5 minutes each side, or until cooked through, (pierce the chicken with a knife or scewer in the thickest part and check that the meat is not pink and the juices run clear). Remove from the heat and keep warm. To make the potato salad, heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the sliced par-boiled potatoes and pan fry for eight minutes, or until golden. Add the balsamic vinegar and season well. Cook for one minute. To make the pesto, put all the pesto ingredients into a small blender or food processor and blend until smooth. To serve, pile the potato salad up on a serving plate, top with the chicken and pour over the pesto.
