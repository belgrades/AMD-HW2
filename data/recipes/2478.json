For the crêpes, place the flour, eggs, milk and double cream into a bowl and mix to make a smooth batter. Heat half of the butter in a non-stick frying pan, place a ladleful of batter into the pan, swirl around to coat the base of the pan and cook for one minute on each side, or until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining mixture to make a second pancake. For the cranberry compote, place the cranberries, orange juice and brown sugar into a saucepan and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, until thickened. To serve, place the pancakes onto a plate with the clementines. Place the cranberry compote into the middle of each pancake and roll up like a cigar.
