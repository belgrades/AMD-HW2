Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter.  Stir in the sultanas, sugar and then the milk to get a soft dough. Turn on to a floured work surface and knead very lightly. Pat out to a round 2cm\/Â¾in thick. Use a 5cm\/2in cutter to stamp out rounds and place on a baking sheet. Lightly knead together the rest of the dough and stamp out more scones to use it all up. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden.
