For the strawberry layer, place the lemon juice and water into a small saucepan and mix in the cornflour well.  Bring to the boil and when the cornflour is dissolved, mix in the sugar and the strawberries. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat, and allow to cool and thicken. For the cheesecake mixture, soften the gelatine in the lemon juice and a spoonful of water if needed, for 3-5 minutes. Heat the mixture gently over a low heat in a small saucepan until the gelatine is completely dissolved.  Meanwhile whisk the cream cheese and the sugar in a mixer or blender on medium speed. When the sugar is dissolved turn down the speed and add the yoghurt and the gelatine. When the mixture is blended together add the vanilla extract. To assemble, place the biscuit layer into the base of six wine glasses, add a good dollop of cheesecake mixture, then add some strawberries. Chill the mixture for a few hours and top with whipped cream and a sprig of mint. Serve immediately.
