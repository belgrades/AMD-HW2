Put the remaining ingredients in another bowl and mix. Pour the marinade over the chicken and toss to coat. Cover with cling film and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight. When you are ready to cook the chicken, preheat the oven to 220C\/200C Fan\/Gas 7 or heat up the barbecue. If you are using a barbecue, allow the flames to flare up and die down until the coals are just glowing before you start to cook the chicken.  If cooking in the oven, transfer the chicken and marinade to a roasting tin in a single layer. Roast or barbecue for about 30 minutes, turning once halfway through, or until cooked through and a deep golden-brown. Serve hot or cold with salad and coleslaw.
