To make the cake, place the flour in a large bowl and beat in the egg. Whisk in enough carbonated water to create a batter the consistency of double cream. Add the sugar and vanilla seeds and stir in.  Add the cooked noodles and stir well. Gently melt the butter in a small oven-proof non-stick frying pan. Pour in the cake mixture and cook for 3-5 minutes to set. Transfer to the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes, until golden and cooked through. To make the sauce, heat the orange juice and sugar in a pan over a medium heat to form a caramel.  Add the mango slices and shake the pan to ensure all the mango is coated in caramel. Cook for 3-4 more minutes until the mango is caramelised. To serve, remove the noodle cake from the oven and turn out onto a plate. Pour the caramelised mangoes over the top and serve with a dollop of Greek yoghurt.
