Remove from the pan and slice or tear into bite-sized pieces. Place the cheese and cream into a small pan and over a low-medium heat and stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth. Add the spinach leaves to the pan and stir until just wilted. Transfer the creamy spinach to a serving plate and top with the bacon and croutons. Bring a pan of water to the boil.
