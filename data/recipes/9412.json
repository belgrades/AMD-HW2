Mix together the ginger, garlic, chilli, turmeric, cumin, lemon juice and some salt, add the chicken livers and mix until they are thoroughly coated. Heat the oil to smoking point in a large heavy-bottomed frying pan, then add the livers. Don t stir them too much, just shake the pan to toss them or stir very lightly with a wooden spatula.   Cook for 4-5 minutes, until browned on the outside but still pink on the inside, or longer if you prefer them well done. Toss in the coriander and mint and check the seasoning, adding a squeeze of lemon juice if you like and serve immediately. Sprinkle sliced onion tossed with some chopped coriander, mint and lime juice, on the bottom of the tortilla then place the liver about and roll. Serve.
