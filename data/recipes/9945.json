Pierce the chicken pieces all over with a fork and add to the marinade. Leave to marinate in the fridge for a few hours, if possible, bringing the chicken back to room temperature before cooking. To cook the chicken, preheat the grill to medium. Brush the grill rack liberally with oil and place some aluminium foil on the oven floor to catch any drips. Thread the chicken pieces onto the skewers, spacing them apart so they do not touch. Grill for 6-8 minutes, turning halfway through the cooking time. Then baste the chicken with the butter and grill for another minute, or until slightly charred at the edges and completely cooked through. Using a fork, slide the chicken pieces off the skewers and sprinkle over the chaat masala, if using. Divide the chicken into five equal portions and place each portion in the middle of a warmed tortilla. Top with the sliced vegetables and a spoonful of the chutney. Fold over the top of the tortilla and pull in the sides. Cut in half on the diagonal and serve.
