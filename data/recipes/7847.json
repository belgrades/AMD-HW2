Use a small, sharp knife to make 12-14 slits all over the lamb. Peel two garlic cloves and slice them into shards. Roughly squash the remaining garlic and put into the bottom of a large roasting tin.  Push a few slivers of garlic and small sprigs of rosemary down into each slit in the lamb and season with plenty of salt and pepper. Put the carrots and onions into the roasting tin, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Lay the lamb on top and roast in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.  For the mint sauce, mix together the sugar and vinegar until the sugar is dissolved. Add the mint and mix well. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the fridge to steep. Remove the lamb from the oven, pour in the wine then return to the oven and roast for a further 45 minutes.  When cooked, remove the lamb from the oven and transfer to a board.
