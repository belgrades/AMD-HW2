Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to heat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Measure the dried mixed fruit into a cup then add some pear juice from the tinned fruit – put to one side for five minutes while you chop up the pear.  Chop up the pear into a bowl with the scissors – ask a grown-up to help you use the scissors. Drain the mixed fruit and add it to the pear.  Ask a grown-up to help you melt the butter in small saucepan, then place into a mixing bowl with the mixed spice and the sugar. Stir with the pastry brush. Spread out a sheet of filo with the short side nearest to you and brush the filo with the butter mixture. Place a quarter of the fruit mix in the centre at the edge nearest to you and then fold in the long sides to cover the mixture.  Brush the filo again with some more of your butter mix, then roll up the length of the pastry to make a parcel. Repeat to make four parcels and brush the top of each with the remaining butter mixture. Place onto a baking tray. Ask a grown-up to put them in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes. Leave to cool before eating as the filling is very hot! Serve the parcels with plain yoghurt.
