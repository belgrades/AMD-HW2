Add the milk and stir to make a soft dough. Grease a pudding basin with butter and spoon the mixture into the basin. Cover with a piece of folded greaseproof paper. Tie around the edge with string to secure the paper and place a damp tea towel over the top. Tie once more with string to secure the tea towel. Place the basin into a large lidded saucepan and fill the pan two-thirds of the way up with water. Cover with the lid, bring to a boil and simmer for one hour. For the custard, place the milk and cream into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Place the egg yolks and sugar into a bowl and whisk together until light and frothy. Pour the hot milk onto the eggs, a little at a time, and stir well. Pour the mixture back into the pan and cook over a low heat, stirring with a wooden spatula, until just thickened. To serve, slice a wedge of spotted dick for each person and place onto each of six plates. Pour over the custard and serve at once.
