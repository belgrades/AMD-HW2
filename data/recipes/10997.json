{"recipe_name":"Warm salad of tea-smoked trout with crispy bacon, frisée and horseradish","author":"James Martin","programme":"Stately Suppers","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 6-8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the tea-smoked trout, put the sugar, rice and tea leaves into a bowl and mix together. Line a wok with heavy-duty kitchen foil and pour the mixture on top. Cover with another layer of foil, drizzle over some olive oil and place the trout on top. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then cover with another sheet of foil, sealing it tightly around the edges. Place on the hob over a moderate heat and leave the trout to smoke for a few minutes. Set aside. (CAUTION: tea-smoking generates a lot of smoke. Cook in a well-ventilated area.) For the dressing, bring the stock to the boil in a saucepan and continue to boil, uncovered, until reduced by half. Leave to cool. Whip the cream until stiff peaks form, then fold in the creamed horseradish, the cooled fish stock and cider. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the salad, place the bacon on a baking tray and cook in the oven until crisp. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a frying pan and cook the apple slices until soft and golden. Remove the bacon from the oven and, when cold enough to handle, break into bite-size pieces. Arrange the frisée lettuce on serving plates. Scatter the bacon on top, drizzle over some of the dressing, then scatter over the apple slices and chopped herbs. Spoon over the remainder of the dressing and top with the smoked trout.  Drizzle with a little olive oil and serve immediately.
