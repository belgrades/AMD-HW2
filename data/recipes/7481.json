Spoon 100g\/3½oz of the golden syrup into the base of the pudding basins and set aside. Beat the remaining 100g\/3½oz golden syrup, butter, sugar and lemon zest together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in half the eggs followed by half the flour and when well combined, add the remaining eggs and flour. The mixture should be at a just dropping consistency. (Add a splash of milk if the mixture is very thick.) Spoon the mixture into the pudding basins until three-quarters full, then smooth the surface with the back of a spoon. Loosely cover with clingfilm (allow room for the clingfilm to inflate as the mixture rises) and place in the microwave for five minutes. (Cook one pudding at a time.) The pudding is done when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to stand for five minutes. Run a blunt knife around the edge of the pudding to loosen the sides, carefully invert onto a deep plate and remove the basin. To serve, spoon the extra syrup over the pudding, cut into generous wedges and serve with custard.
