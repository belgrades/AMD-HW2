Cover the bowl with cling film and place into the fridge to marinate for four hours. Heat a deep fat fryer to 190C, or place the oil in a deep heavy-based pan so that it half-fills the pan. Heat until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Remove the ribs from the fridge and drain off any excess marinade. Carefully place into the hot oil in batches of 2-3 ribs at a time and cook until nicely browned. Remove the ribs with a slotted spoon and drain on to kitchen paper. For the sauce, place all of the sauce ingredients into a large shallow pan with a lid and stir to combine. Place the pan over a medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the fried ribs and bring the sauce back to a simmer. Cover and cook for 40-50 minutes until the ribs are tender, turning the ribs several times during the cooking time. Remove the lid for the last five minutes of cooking. For the cabbage, heat a frying pan until hot, then add the oil, garlic, ginger and chilli and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the cabbage and stir-fry for a further 2-3 minutes, or until the cabbage is just wilted. Add the soy sauce and stir to combine. To serve, spoon a little cabbage onto each plate. Place two ribs onto each plate and serve with extra sauce in a serving jug alongside.
