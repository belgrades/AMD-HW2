Add the egg, flour and milk and blend again to a smooth batter. Grease two ramekins and add a tablespoon of marmalade into the bottom of each. Divide the sponge batter between the two ramekins making sure that the marmalade bottom is covered completely. Leave a few inches of room at the top for the sponges to rise. Cover with cling film and cook in the microwave at its highest setting for 4-5 minutes. Remove the cling film, loosen the edges of the sponge with a knife, and turn out the sponges onto two serving plates. For the orange syrup, place the marmalade and orange juice into a small pan over a low heat and gently warm through. For the crème anglaise, place the egg yolks, cornflour, sugar and cardamom into a small pan and stir until combined. Place over a low heat and gradually add the milk, stirring constantly, until thickened. To serve, pour the orange syrup over each sponge and serve the cardamom crème anglaise in a jug alongside.
