Line a 33cm X 23cm (13in x 10in) Swiss roll tin with greased non-stick baking paper. Whisk the egg whites in a clean, large bowl with an electric mixer on full speed until very stiff. Gradually add the sugar, one teaspoon at a time and, keeping the mixer on a high speed, whisk well between each addition.   Whisk until very, very stiff and glossy and all the sugar has been added. Spread the meringue mixture into the lined tin and sprinkle with the almonds. Place the tin in the oven and bake for about eight minutes until golden.   Lower the temperature to 160C\/320F\/Gas 3 and bake for a further 15 minutes until crisp and firm to the touch. Remove the meringue from the oven and turn almond-side down onto a sheet of non-stick baking paper. Remove the paper from the base of the cooked meringue and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Lightly whip the cream and mix with the yoghurt. Spread evenly over the meringue. Cut the strawberries into quarters and sprinkle over the cream mixture. Roll up the meringue firmly, using the paper to help you, from the long end of the roulade. It is essential to keep the roll very tight. Wrap in non-stick baking paper and chill before serving. Serve dusted with icing sugar.
