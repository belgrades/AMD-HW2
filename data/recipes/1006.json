Pour over the beer, cover and place in the fridge for at least 12 hours, but preferably overnight. Preheat the oven to 150C\/300F\/Gas 2. Lift the beef cheeks out from the vegetables, pat dry, then season with salt and pepper. Reserve the marinade. Heat a large casserole or ovenproof pan until hot, add the olive oil and a knob of the butter. When foaming, add the beef cheeks two at a time and fry on each side until browned. Remove and set aside. Return the beef to the pan with the reserved marinade and add the beef stock. Bring to a simmer then cover with a lid, leaving the lid slightly ajar so you have a 1cm\/½in gap at the side. Cook in the oven for 4-5 hours. Meanwhile, put the whole carrots, star anise, 100g\/3½oz of the butter, a pinch of salt and the sugar into a pan and add enough water to just cover. Set on a low heat and cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the carrots are tender and glazed. Remove the casserole from the oven and strain the sauce into a saucepan, then place over the heat and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced and is thick enough to just coat the back of a spoon.  Whisk in the remaining butter until the sauce is shiny. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. For the mash, place the potatoes into a pan of cold, salted water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Drain and return to the pan, then place over a low heat for a couple of minutes to dry the potatoes slightly. Meanwhile, put the butter and milk into a saucepan and simmer until the butter is melted. Pass the potatoes through a ricer, then add the hot butter and milk (or cream) and beat to form a very smooth mash. Season, to taste, with salt and black pepper. To serve, lift out the beef cheeks and place in shallow bowls. Spoon the mash alongside and finish with a generous ladleful of sauce.
