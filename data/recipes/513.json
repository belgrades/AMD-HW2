Score the duck breast in a criss-cross pattern. Place the duck breast into a cold pan, skin-side down, and cook on a high heat for three minutes.  Strain off and discard the fat. For the figs, place the figs into the saucepan with the duck and cook for a further two minutes.  Then place into the preheated oven for four minutes. Take out of the oven, remove the duck and figs, and deglaze the pan with honey and balsamic vinegar.  Finish with the butter and rest for three minutes. For the rösti, in a small frying pan heat the oil until hot. Add the grated potato and season with the salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover the base of the pan, with the potatoes.  Turn over after three minutes or when golden brown.  Cook for a further two minutes. For the crispy leeks, heat the oil in a large saucepan or deep-fryer. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the leek strips and drain on kitchen paper. Serve the duck on top of the rösti with the balsamic figs and crispy leeks to garnish.
