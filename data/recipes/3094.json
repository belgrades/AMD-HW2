(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the chives, cumin seeds, turmeric and flour into a bowl and mix well. Gradually whisk in enough sparkling water to make a smooth batter the consistency of double cream. Dip the cauliflower florets into the batter to coat completely, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the cauliflower into the hot oil. Deep fry for about 4-5 minutes, or until lightly golden-brown. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To serve, place onto a serving plate and sprinkle with salt.
