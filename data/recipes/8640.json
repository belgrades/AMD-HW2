Do not leave unattended.) Chop the prepared squid into cubes. On a shallow plate mix together the plain flour, paprika, cayenne and turmeric. Coat the squid in the flour mixture and drop into the hot oil. Remove when crisp and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Preheat a griddle pan and season the sea bream with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Griddle the bream for three minutes each side until cooked. Meanwhile for the salad, mix all of the salad ingredients together in a bowl. Set aside. For the dressing, whisk together the olive oil and Dijon mustard in a bowl until smooth. Add the parsley, crushed coriander seeds and the lemon juice and mix well.  Set aside. For the aioli, in a food processor, blend the egg yolks, garlic, saffron and little of the olive oil. With the mixer running, add the remainder of the olive oil gradually in a thin stream until it emulsifies and you have a thick sauce consistency. Just before serving, toss the salad in the dressing. Serve the fish with the deep-fried squid, dressed salad and a dollop of aioli on the side.
