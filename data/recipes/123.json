On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to 3-4mm\/⅛in thick. Cut out four 12cm\/4½in circles using a pastry cutter and transfer to a baking tray. Score a circle in the centre of the pastry with a knife (leaving a 1cm\/½in border) then brush with egg wash. Roll the marzipan out to 5mm\/¼in thick and cut into four 11cm\/4¼in circles and place in the centre of the pastry. Carefully place the apples in an overlapping ring over the marzipan to cover it all. Place the butter and honey in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring to combine. Brush most of it over the top of the apples. Place in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the pastry is risen and golden-brown. Brush with any remaining melted butter and honey to glaze. For the spiced caramel sauce, place the sugar and spices in a frying pan and cook until the sugar is melted and golden-brown. Whisk in the double cream and bring to a simmer. Cook for 3-5 minutes, or until just thickened, then pass through a fine sieve into a clean pan. To serve, place the tarts in the centre of serving plates and spoon the sauce around the edge. Finish with a spoonful of ice cream on top.
