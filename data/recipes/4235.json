Fry for 2-3 minutes until golden and completely cooked through. Carefully remove the cooked balls with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the syrup, place the water, sugar and lemon juice into a pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1-2 minutes. Carefully place the jamun balls into the syrup and roll around to completely coat. Remove from the heat and leave to absorb the syrup for ten minutes. To serve, place the strawberries and raspberries into a bowl and sprinkle with the icing sugar, stirring gently to coat evenly. Place the strawberries and raspberries onto a large serving dish and top with the gulab jamun.
