For the salted caramel buttercream, heat the caster sugar and four tablespoons of water in a saucepan over a gentle heat until the sugar has dissolved, then increase the heat and cook the caramel for 2-3 minutes, or until golden and slightly thickened. Remove the pan from the heat immediately and stir in the cream. (CAUTION: the caramel may splutter a little when you add the cream.) Stir in the salt and vanilla and set aside to cool completely. Cream the butter and icing sugar together for at least 4- 5 minutes, then beat in the caramel.  When combined pipe or spread the icing over the cup cakes and sprinkle with a little extra sea salt. Decorate the cupcakes with the buttercream.
