For the chicken, place the chicken into the bowl of marinade. Stir well and leave to marinate in the fridge, covered in cling film for at least one hour. Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat a griddle pan until hot then add the marinated chicken strips. Cook over a high heat for 1-2 minutes, turning once so they brown nicely on both sides. Transfer the chicken strips to a baking sheet and place into the oven to cook for a further five minutes, or until completely cooked through.  Remove the chicken from the oven and season with coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle with the spring onions and toasted sesame seeds.   For the guacamole, place the chopped avocados into a bowl and add the lime juice. Add the remaining guacamole ingredients, mix well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, place the chicken onto six plates with a spoonful of guacamole served alongside each.
