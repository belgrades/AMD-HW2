Grease and line a 20cm\/8in springform cake tin. For the topping, place the flour, sugar, cinnamon and butter into a bowl and, using your fingertips, rub the mixture together until it resembles breadcrumbs. Set aside. For the cake, beat the eggs, butter and sugar in a bowl for five minutes with an electric whisk. Stir in the soured cream, then fold in the flour, cinnamon, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda until well combined and smooth. Spoon half of the mixture into the cake tin, top with the cherries, then the remaining cake mixture. Sprinkle over the topping. Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to cool for 5 minutes. For the glaze, whisk the icing sugar and two tablespoons of milk together in a bowl. (Add a little extra milk if the mixture is too thick.) Spoon the glaze over the top of the cake and set aside for 10 minutes, or until the glaze hardens.
