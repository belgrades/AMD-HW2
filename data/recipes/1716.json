Spoon the mixture into the cases and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes. For the icing, mix the icing sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth.  Using an apple corer, carefully remove the middle of the cupcakes. Fill the holes with the raspberry jam.
