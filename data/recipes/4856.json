Kid’s job: Chop the fruit into chunks. Don’t worry about the size being perfect, it is good to have a variety of chunks! (An adult should supervise this.) Kid’s job: Place the fruit into an ovenproof dish and pour over the orange juice and the brown sugar. Kid’s job: Place the flour into a mixing bowl and chop the butter into small lumps. They can then rub in the butter roughly using their fingertips. This doesn’t have to be perfect, a few lumps are fine. Kid’s job: Stir in the oats, sugar and spices to the cobbler mix and stir it through with a spoon or your hands. Kid’s job: Add the yoghurt one spoonful at a time. You may need to mix with your hands to form a rough dough.  Kid’s job: Form the cobbler mix into small balls, about the size of a ping pong ball and arrange them over the top of the fruit. Adult’s job: Place in the oven for 30-40 minutes or until the cobbler is golden-brown on top with the fruit bubbling up around the edges. Leave to cool before serving as the fruit filling will be very hot. Serve warm with ice cream, yoghurt or custard.
