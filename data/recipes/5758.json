Grease the financier moulds and set onto a baking tray. Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Add the icing sugar and ground almonds and stir to mix.  Add the egg whites and whisk everything thoroughly for one minute with a wire whisk. Heat the butter in a small pan until the solids just start to brown. Tip the butter into the financier mix through a tea strainer. Add the finely shredded basil leaves. Leave the mixture to rest for 5-10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a 1cm\/½in plain nozzle. Pipe into the silicone financier moulds, filling them three-quarters full.  Place two raspberries (if small) or one (if large) cut into two halves into the basil financiers.  Bake for 10-12 minutes until just golden-brown (may need up to 15 minutes to cook). Remove from the oven and leave the baked financiers in their moulds for 1-2 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to finish cooling. When cooled, lightly dust the financiers with sifted icing sugar.
