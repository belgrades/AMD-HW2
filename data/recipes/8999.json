Spoon over the olive oil and sprinkle with the thyme, garlic and seasoning and set aside for at least two hours. Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Grease six individual loose-bottomed tartlet tins.  Divide the pastry into six equal portions and roll each portion out to line the pastry tins.  Prick each pastry case all over with a fork and line with greaseproof paper. Fill with rice or dried beans and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove and set aside.   Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the leeks for five minutes until softened but not coloured. In a bowl, beat together the eggs, yolks and cream and season well. Fold in the cooked smoked haddock, fried leeks, chilli, lemon juice and zest and mix well. Divide between the six tart cases and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Cool the tarts slightly, turn out from the cases and serve with the tomato salad.
