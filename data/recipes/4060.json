Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked. Drain the bulgur wheat, allow to cool and add to a large bowl. Soak the chipotle dried chillies in hot water for five minutes until soft, remove and add to a food processor. Heat a small frying pan and heat the fenugreek, cumin and coriander seeds until they start to give off a strong smell, then add them to the food processor. Add the garlic, shallots, chillies and oil to the food processor and blend until smooth. Add a couple of tablespoons of the mix to the bulgur wheat and stir. Add the pine nuts, pomegranate, mint, coriander, lemon juice and zest and finish with salt and pepper and a little olive oil. Set aside. For the griddled lamb chops, heat a large griddle pan and dip the rosemary bunch in the olive oil. Brush the chops with the oil-soaked rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the chops for a couple of minutes each side continuing to brush with the rosemary and oil. To serve, place the tabbouleh in the centre of each of four plates and lean the lamb chops up against the tabbouleh.
