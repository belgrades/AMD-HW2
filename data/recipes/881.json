Dip the steak in the egg white, then press into the crushed peppercorns to coat the steak. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat and fry the steak for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan and set aside to keep warm. For the red wine jus, add the red wine to the pan used to cook the steak, retaining the steak juices. Bring to a simmer, then add the red wine vinegar, butter and salt and cook for 1-2 minutes, until thickened slightly. To serve, place the toast onto a serving plate, top with the steak and pour over the red wine jus. Serve with steamed purple sprouting broccoli.
