Gradually add the water, a little at a time, until the mixture comes together to make a soft, smooth dough - the quantity of water will depend on the texture of the cornmeal. Knead lightly, then set aside. Cover a work surface with cling film and sift the remaining 25g\/1oz cornmeal evenly over it. Grease your palms with oil, then divide the dough into 12 lemon-sized balls and flatten them with your hands. Roll out a piece of flattened dough into a 0.5cm\/Â¼in thick round on the prepared work surface. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Heat a griddle or frying pan and cook each piece of dough as you go along. Fry on both sides until slightly puffed up and speckled with brown spots. Serve immediately, spread with butter, or wrap in aluminium foil for later use.
