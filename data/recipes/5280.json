Set aside. In a saucepan, heat the remaining almond milk with the sugar, vanilla essence, rosewater and cardamom pods over a medium heat, stirring until mixed well. Once the mixture has heated through, discard the cardamom pods, then pour in the cornflour paste and whisk vigorously until the mixture is smooth and has thickened to an almost custard-like consistency; this will take 10-15 minutes. Be careful not to let the mixture stick to the bottom of the pan. Pour the mixture into individual dishes or a large serving bowl and decorate with a sprinkling of ground pistachios or almonds and the ground cardamom. Set aside to cool, then cover and chill in the fridge for at least 15 minutes. Serve chilled.
