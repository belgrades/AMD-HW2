If the dough is too dry add a little bit of water. Dust a wooden board or clean work surface with a little flour and knead the mixture until it forms a dough. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Dust the pasta with a little four, then roll it through a pasta machine until it is about 2mm thick (around setting number five on the pasta machine). Alternatively roll out the dough using a rolling pin. Cut the pasta dough into rectangles approximately 5x2.5cm\/2x1in. Pinch the rectangles in the middle to form a bow shape. (This can be done up to 24 hours before cooking the dish.) For the spinach, gorgonzola and walnuts, blanch the broccoli in a pan of boiling water and then refresh in a bowl of cold water and drain. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan and add the garlic. After a minute add the spinach and broccoli. Tear the cheese into bite-size pieces and add to the spinach. Meanwhile, dry fry the walnuts in a separate pan.  Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling water for two minutes. Drain thoroughly. Add the drained pasta to the spinach, stir through the mint and top with the walnuts.
