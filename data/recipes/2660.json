{"recipe_name":"Courgette and parmesan risotto with griddled squid","author":"Gino D'Acampo","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Heat the butter in a large pan and gently fry the onion until softened but not coloured. Add the courgette and rice and stir well to coat the grains in oil. Add the stock a little at a time, stirring well and ensuring all the stock has been absorbed before the next addition. When all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is tender, stir in the cheese and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and set aside. For the griddled squid, place the olive oil and garlic into a bowl. Place the squid into the bowl and stir well to coat it. Heat a griddle pan until hot and cook the squid for 2-3 minutes, turning frequently, until chargrilled and cooked through but still tender (do not overcook or it will become tough). Drizzle over the lemon juice, sprinkle over the parsley and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, place the risotto into bowls. Divide the squid into two pieces and top each portion of risotto with squid.
