Heat the milk in a saucepan over a low heat and stir in the coffee granules. Stir for 2-3 minutes, or until the granules have dissolved.

Using a small ring cutter the size of a ramekin, cut out six circles of bread and soak them in the milk and coffee mixture in the pan.  Press a soaked bread piece into the bottom of each of two ramekins. Next, place a handful of the dates on top, followed by another slice of the bread.
