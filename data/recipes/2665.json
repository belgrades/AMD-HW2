{"recipe_name":"Courgette fritters","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the fritters, mix the flour, baking powder, paprika, salt and freshly ground black pepper and sugar in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together. Gradually add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients, whisking constantly, to form a smooth batter. Place the courgettes, sweetcorn and spring onions into a bowl and mix well. Add some of the batter to the vegetable mixture - just enough to bind the vegetables together. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Place a large spoonful of the fritter mixture into the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown all over. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Set aside in a warm place and repeat the process until all the fritter mixture is used up.  For the salsa, crush the olives gently with a pestle and mortar (or blend with a food processor). Place the olives into a bowl with all of the other salsa ingredients and mix well. To serve, place two fritters on each plate and serve a dollop of salsa alongside.
