Place the potato wedges, olive oil, dried herbs, bashed garlic and a decent pinch of salt and pepper into a mixing bowl. Mix well with your hands to coat the potatoes in the herby oil. Tip into a large roasting tray, ideally in a single layer and place into the preheated oven. Roast for 35-45 minutes, turning now and again until evenly golden-brown, crisp on the outside and cooked through inside. Meanwhile, mix together the yoghurt, lime zest, lime juice, mustard and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Add the shredded cabbage, mixing well so that everything is coated. Just before serving sprinkle in the smoked mackerel, fold once to roughly mix and serve with the hot potato wedges.
