Mix the flour and eggs together until you get a dough.   Knead for about five minutes, then wrap in cling film and place in the fridge for about an hour.   Roll out the pasta in a thin sheet, approx. 1 mm in thickness.   Dust the sheet of pasta with some flour and carefully roll it up loosely.  With a sharp knife, slice into ribbons like tagliatelle.   Set aside and cover with cling film so the pasta does not dry out.   To make the pesto, place all the ingredients in a mixer and whiz until you get a smooth consistency.  Set aside.   Take the prawns, remove the shells leaving the head and tail, and with a sharp knife make an incision in the spine and remove the black line.   Fill with two anchovy fillets and close.  Take a handful of pasta ribbons and wrap around the prawn from head to tail.   Heat abundant oil in a fryer or deep pan and deep-fry the prawns for a couple of minutes.   Remove and drain on kitchen paper and season with salt.   Place some pesto sauce on a plate and place a prawn on top and serve immediately.
