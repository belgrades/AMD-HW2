Heat a frying pan and fry the tuna briefly to the pan, so that it just simply gets a little browned on the outside (it should still be completely raw inside). Slice the tuna as thinly as possible and lay out the slices on a serving dish. Toast the pine nuts with a little salt in a dry frying pan. Mix the avocado and coriander with the pine nuts. Season with salt, black pepper and sesame oil.  For the dressing, mix half the jalapeño chilli pepper with the soy sauce and lemon juice. Spoon it over the fish. Garnish with the remaining jalapeño and serve.
