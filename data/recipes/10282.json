Heat a frying pan until very hot. Add the tuna steak and sear for two minutes on each side, until browned and cooked through. Pour over the soy and honey and allow to cook and caramelise for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat, sprinkle with sesame seeds and set aside. To make the noodles, heat the vegetable oil in a deep, heavy bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when added to it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous, do not leave unattended.) Carefully add the rice noodles to the hot oil. They will puff up and cook in a few seconds, then carefully remove and drain on kitchen towels. To serve, place the tuna on a small warm plate and place the crispy noodles in a bowl alongside.
