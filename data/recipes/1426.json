Heat 50g\/1¾oz of butter in a heavy frying pan, over a medium heat and put in the steaks. For medium-rare, cook for roughly 3 minutes on each side, then remove from the pan.  Take the pan off the heat, pour in the reserved oyster water and scrape any bits from the bottom to the surface. Finally, pour the resulting liquid over the steaks. To make the potatoes pre heat the oven to 190C\/375F\/ Gas 5.  Warm the olive oil in a heavy casserole dish over a medium heat. Add the potatoes, tomatoes, onions, garlic cloves, thyme and sage and bring to the boil. Season well and simmer for 8-10 minutes, then cover and cook in the oven for half an hour, or until the potatoes are cooked through (do not stir as this will break up the vegetables).  Allow to cool slightly, then add the olives and parsley. Finally, serve with the carpet bag steaks.
