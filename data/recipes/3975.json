In a small bowl, mix the gorgonzola cheese and thyme leaves together. Heat a small ovenproof, non-stick frying pan and place the lamb cutlets, fat-side down, into the pan until the fat has melted and is crisp and golden-brown. Turn the lamb cutlets over and brown on the other side. Divide the herb gorgonzola cheese into two and press onto the top of the lamb cutlets. Transfer the pan to the oven for 3-4 minutes, or until the lamb is cooked to your liking. For the green bean salad, bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the green beans for two minutes.
