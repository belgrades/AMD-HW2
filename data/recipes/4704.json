{"recipe_name":"Individual summer puddings with summer berries","author":"Emma Crowhurst","programme":"Food and Drink","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 10","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Line 10 timbales with pieces of cling film, or use teacups without cling film. Check over the fruit and remove all stalks and blemishes. Place the water and sugar into a large pan and bring to the boil. Add the firmest, most acidic fruits first leaving the strawberries and raspberries until last. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 5-10 minutes. The redcurrant and blackcurrants should begin to burst slightly. Taste the fruit and stir in more caster sugar if necessary. Drain the fruit into a large colander and save the juice. Allow the fruit to cool. Save half the juice to dip the bread into. Place the remaining juice back into the pan and reduce until slightly syrupy, set aside for the sauce. When the fruit is cool, begin to assemble the summer puddings. Cut 10 of the slices of bread in half and then each half into 4 triangles. From the other 10 slices, cut 2 discs from each slice of bread, 1 small for the base and one large for the top of the pudding.  Dip the bread, a few pieces at a time, into the thinner syrup and line the timbales. Place the small circle on the bottom and the triangles around the sides of the timbale. Fill each timbale with the fruit mix and use the larger circle to top the pudding. Wrap the cling film up and cover the timbale. Place onto a tray and when all the puddings are done put another tray on the top with a weight of some kind to press the puddings. Chill for at least a couple of hours and serve with the reduced sauce and fresh summer berries. Dust the fresh berries with icing sugar.
