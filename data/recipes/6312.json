Sift the flour, baking powder and caster sugar into a bowl. Using a whisk, add the eggs and the milk. Be careful not to overwhisk. Put to one side. Put the bacon on an oven tray and bake until crisp. Remove and brush over a little of the maple syrup. To cook the pancakes, preheat a non-stick frying pan. Add a little butter and pour around three spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan - the pancakes should be quite small. Cook until golden brown and turn over to colour the other side. Remove and place on a large plate. To serve, pile the pancakes on the plate and arrange the bacon around and on top. Drizzle with maple syrup and serve.
