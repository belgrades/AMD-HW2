Grease and line 2 x 18cm\/7in cake tins with baking paper.  Cream the butter and the sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy.  Beat in the eggs, a little at a time, and stir in the vanilla extract.  Fold in the flour using a large metal spoon, adding a little extra milk if necessary, to create a batter with a soft dropping consistency. Divide the mixture between the cake tins and gently spread out with a spatula.  Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes, then remove from the tin and peel off the paper. Place onto a wire rack. Sandwich the cakes together with jam, lemon curd or whipped cream and berries or just enjoy on its own.
