Pour the mixture into the pastry case and bake for 10 minutes and then reduce the oven heat to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4 and bake for another 30 minutes or until the top of the pie is golden. Check if it s cooked through by inserting a skewer, it s done if it comes out clean. Turn out of the tin when slightly cooled and serve warm or cold with vanilla ice cream or a spoonful of cr√®me fraiche.
