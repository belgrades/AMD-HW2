{"recipe_name":"Pissaladière tart with anchovy tapenade and roasted cannon of lamb with rosemary and garlic","author":"Matt Tebbutt","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/180C Fan\/Gas 6. For the pissaladière tart, cut out two 10cm\/4in circles from the puff pastry and place on a baking tray. Dot the circles with the tip of a sharp knife.  Heat the butter in a frying pan and fry the onions for 10 minutes until crisp. Put 6 of the anchovy halves and black olives in a small food processor and blend until smooth. Gradually add the olive oil and lemon juice then season with salt and pepper. Spread the paste over the pastry and top with the fried onions. Lay the remaining anchovies in a criss-cross pattern over the top of each tart. Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown. Keep warm until ready to serve. For the lamb, reduce the oven temperature to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4.  Heat an ovenproof frying pan and add the oil and butter. Once hot, add the lamb, rosemary and garlic. Fry until the lamb is coloured on all sides. Transfer to the oven for 6–8 minutes or until cooked to your liking, then remove from the oven and set aside to rest. Keep the pan to make the port reduction. For the port reduction, heat the pan used for the lamb and add the port. Cook until the volume of liquid is reduced by half. Add the stock and reduce again by half. Finish with the olive oil, olives, chopped tomatoes and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, carve the lamb into slices. Place a tart on each serving plate and top with the sliced lamb and port reduction.
