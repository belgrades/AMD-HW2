To make the stuffed chicken breast, cut the chicken breast in half (but not right through) and fold outwards - this is called butterflying the chicken breast. Cut the mozzarella and lay across the flat chicken, three slices should be enough. Fold the chicken breast back together and wrap the parma ham around it. In a medium-sized frying pan, heat the oil, sear the chicken breast until golden. Add the garlic and place into the pre-heated oven for 8-10 minutes. To make the leek and tomato sauce, add all the ingredients into a medium-sized saucepan and cook for three minutes. Serve with the chicken. To make the griddled potatoes, toss the sliced potatoes in olive oil, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place onto a hot griddle pan and cook for 4-5 minutes turning occasionally. Serve with the chicken and tomato sauce.
