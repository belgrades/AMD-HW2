{"recipe_name":"Sweet and spicy duck with potato galette and orange vinaigrette","author":"Tony Tobin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the duck, place the salt, coriander seeds, chilli flakes and cardamom pod into a mortar and pestle and pound together. Stir in the oil to make a paste. Rub the spice paste all over the duck. Heat a frying pan and fry the duck breast skin-side down for 8-10 minutes, or until a lot of the fat has been released and the skin is golden-brown and crisp.  Drain off any excess fat into a bowl. Turn over and fry for a further 3-4 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Remove from the pan and leave to rest for five minutes in a warm place. For the potato galette, boil the potatoes in a saucepan of salted water for five minutes, then drain. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the potato slices until golden-brown.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the vinaigrette, heat the orange zest and juice, vinegar, turmeric and sugar in a small pan and simmer until reduced by half and syrupy. Remove from the heat and whisk in the olive oil. To serve, arrange the potato slices on a serving plate, top with the duck and drizzle over the vinaigrette.
