If you have had to use chunks of a large squid, then just lightly score the inside of the flesh, which will help tenderise it.   Mix the lemon zest, cumin, sea salt, garlic and olive oil and rub into the squid and leave to marinate for a minimum of two hours in the fridge. Heat your grill plate until white patches start to appear. Remove the squid from the marinade and grill either side for no more than two minutes to ensure that you get those lovely black grill lines across the flesh. Push the squid down with the back of a fish slice and do the same with the tentacles. Take the squid off the hot grill and serve on a plate with a sprinkling of sea salt, juice of the lemon and sprinkling of fresh chopped coriander. Serve with a mixed green salad.
