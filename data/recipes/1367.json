Add the apricot halves and cook until caramelised, the sugar and apricots will turn darker in colour.  Add the cream and stir until the sauce thickens slightly. Place the flour and egg into a bowl and whisk together. Whisk in the milk to create a smooth runny batter. Add more milk if needed. Heat the oil in a medium sized non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Add a spoonful of the batter to the pan and cook for one minute, until the base is golden brown, then turn over. Repeat three more times. Place one pancake into the centre of a serving plate and top with the caramelised apricots.  Repeat with another pancake and apricots until you have two layers of each, finishing with a pancake.  Drizzle with the butterscotch sauce.
