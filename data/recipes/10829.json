Kid’s job: Mash the beans or chickpeas as much as you can either with a potato masher in a bowl or with a hand mixer (supervised). Alternatively you could make the mix in a food processor if you have one.  Kid’s job: Add the mashed vegetables and garlic and any herbs, spices or tahini that you want to use. Kid’s job: Mix well and the kids can taste and add lemon juice, spices or pepper to their taste. Kid’s job: The mixture then needs to be rolled into four burger-sized balls with wet hands, or make 12 smaller \"falafels\" - kids have the perfect sized hands for this. Flatten the balls slightly. If you like, you can coat them with sesame seeds, crushed crackers or breadcrumbs for extra crunch. Kid’s job: Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil on a baking tray and place the \"falafels\" or bean burgers on top and then turn them all over so that they have a coating of a little oil on each side. Adult’s job: Place the baking tray in the oven and cook for 20-30 minutes, turning the burgers over midway through cooking. Allow to cool a little before serving.
