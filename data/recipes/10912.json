Place the water, sugar and cranberry juice into a pan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes, then remove from the heat.  Add the vodka and stir to combine.  Remove the gelatine leaves from their soaking water and place into the pan with the cranberry mixture. Stir the cranberry mixture until it begins to thicken, then pour the mixture into a bowl. Place a few blueberries into the bottom of each lined jelly mould.  Top up the moulds with the jelly mix, then place a basil leaf on top of each. Transfer the jellies to the fridge to chill overnight and set. For the sauce, mix the Marsala, sugar and vanilla seeds in a clean bowl. Add the blackberries and leave for two hours. To serve, turn out each jelly onto a small serving plate. Spoon equal amounts of the marinated fruit around each jelly and drizzle with a little double cream.
