Add the wine to the pan to deglaze, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 2-3 more minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half in volume.  For the sauce, add the cream and cheese to the pan with the chicken and bring to a simmer, stirring until the cheese has melted. Finally, stir in the butter and parsley. For the pea and potato purée, cook the potato in a pan of boiling water for 7-9 minutes, or until tender, adding the peas for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking time. Drain and place the peas and potato into a food processor with the olive oil and mint. Blend to a smooth purée, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, spoon the pea and potato purée onto a serving plate and place the chicken strips on top. Drizzle the cream sauce around the edges of the plate.
