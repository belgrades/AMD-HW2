Add the sliced onions, herbs, salt and freshly ground black pepper and the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for an hour and a half. Preheat the oven to 190C\/375F\/Gas 5. Transfer the filling mixture to an ovenproof dish. Line the rim of the dish with a thin strip of pastry. Dampen the pastry rim by brushing with beaten egg. Cut a piece of pastry to fit across the top of the dish and place on top of the dish, pressing the edges together to seal. Decorate with pastry trimmings, make a steam hole in the centre of the pie by slashing with a sharp knife, then brush with more beaten egg. Transfer to the oven and cook for 1-1Â½ hours. If the pastry gets too brown, cover it with foil. Serve hot.
