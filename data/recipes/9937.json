Slice a thin slice off the bottom of the tomatoes so they sit flat on the work surface. Slice off the top, then spoon out the flesh to make a hollow 'cup' shape. Reserve the flesh. Place the hollowed tomatoes onto a baking sheet and drizzle over the honey.  Mix the Stilton with the scooped out tomato flesh, then use the mixture to stuff the tomatoes.
