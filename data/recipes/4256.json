Fry the potatoes and spring onions for a few minutes, to soften. Stir in the curry powder and turmeric to coat. Add the lemon juice to the pan and then pour in the cream.  Add the parsley and cumin seeds and simmer gently for 8-10 minutes, until thickened. For the fish, wrap the pancetta slices around the hake fillet. Heat the oil in a non-stick-frying pan and cook the fish for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the pancetta is golden brown. To serve, transfer the wrapped fish to a serving plate and serve the curried potatoes alongside.
