For the pigeon, lay out the bacon rashers side-by-side on a chopping board. Flatten out the pigeon breasts with a meat mallet or rolling pin, and place side by side across the bacon. Scatter over the orange zest and rosemary, then roll up tightly with the bacon on the outside. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the breasts for 6-8 minutes, until golden-brown all over and cooked through. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest, then slice in half. For the roasted tomatoes, place the tomatoes in an ovenproof frying pan and drizzle over the olive oil. Heat until the oil starts to sizzle, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and transfer to the oven to roast for 6-7 minutes, until softened. For the citrus salad, combine all the salad ingredients together in a bowl and mix gently to combine.  To serve, pile the citrus salad onto a serving plate and place the sliced pigeon on top. Arrange the roasted cherry tomatoes on the side and serve.
