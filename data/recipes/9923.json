Bring a pan of water to the boil, add the plantain slices and cook until tender. Drain and allow to cool. Peel and mash the plantains. In a separate bowl combine all the filling ingredients. Oil hands liberally and lightly press one tablespoon of the mashed plantain into the palm of one hand, make a well in the centre and add a generous pinch of the filling mixture. Close the plantain mixture over the stuffing and very lightly roll into a ball. Continue with the remaining mixture until used up. Heat the oil in a frying pan or wok over a medium heat and add the plantain dumplings. Fry until crisp and golden then remove and drain on kitchen paper. Make the sauce in separate bowl. Mix the yoghurt with the spices and salt to taste. Add a little cream to the mixture until it has the consistency of double cream. Pour half of the sauce onto an oval dish with sides. Place the dumplings on top and then cover the dumplings with the rest of the yoghurt mixture. Garnish with the toasted coconut, pomegranate and the chopped coriander.
