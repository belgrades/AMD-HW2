{"recipe_name":"Chicken goujons with sweetcorn fritters, sautéed potatoes and yellow pepper chilli jam","author":"Tony Tobin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the chicken, rub the oil into the meat and season with the salt and pepper. In an ovenproof griddle pan, heat a small amount of oil over a medium heat and add the chicken pieces, turning them until they are browned all over. Drizzle the honey over the chicken and transfer the pan to the oven for 7-8 minutes to cook the chicken through. For the sweetcorn fritters, mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Using an electric whisk, mix in the eggs and add the milk little by little until the mixture has the consistency of a thick batter. Fold in the sweetcorn. In a large frying pan, heat the oil over a medium heat. Using a large spoon, spoon the batter into the frying pan, keeping the spoonfuls of batter separate so that they form fritters. Fry the fritters for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and cooked through. For the sautéed potatoes, heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over a medium heat and add the potato slices to the oil. Cook for two minutes until they have softened but are not cooked through. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.  Return the potato slices to the hot oil for another five minutes until cooked through, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.  For the yellow pepper chilli jam, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the pepper, tomato, chilli flakes, wine vinegar, sugar and tomato ketchup and cook for 8-10 minutes until the vegetables have visibly softened, then add the sliced mangetout.  To serve, place the chicken goujons on a plate with the sweetcorn fritters and potatoes, and garnish with a spoonful of the pepper chilli jam.
