Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is just simmering. Add the chicken breasts and cover the casserole with a lid. Cook for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. Set aside to cool slightly.  For the lemon sauce, bring the chicken stock, sugar and lemon zest and juice to the boil in a pan, then continue to cook for 4-5 minutes. Whisk in the cornflour paste until the mixture is smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the cooled chicken breasts and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on both sides.  To serve, place one chicken breast onto each of four serving plates. Pour over the lemon sauce. Spoon a portion of egg-fried rice alongside. Sprinkle over a little spring onion.
