Stir in the vinegar, olive oil, Tabasco sauce and lemon juice. Preheat the grill to medium-high. Heat an ovenproof griddle pan until hot. Place the poussins and lemon halves onto the griddle pan and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on both sides.  Transfer to the grill and cook for for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Squeeze the roasted lemon halves over the poussins (take care as the lemon halves will be hot). For the walnut salad, mix the celery, walnuts, stilton, parsley and celery leaves together in a bowl. Whisk the crème fraîche, honey, vinegar and mayonnaise together in a bowl until smooth. Add the dressing to the salad and mix until well combined. Mix the salad with enough of the dressing to coat.
