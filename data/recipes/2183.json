Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper.  For the quick bread, sift together the flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl. Mix in the chopped pecan nuts. Melt the butter with the sugar in a pan, then pour into a clean bowl. Add the buttermilk. Mix the eggs in, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually mix the wet ingredients into the dry using your hands or a freestanding mixer. Turn the dough out on to a lightly floured surface and shape into a loaf. Score the top into portions using a knife. Place on the prepared tray and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the base sounds hollow when tapped. Leave to cool on a wire rack.  For the salted caramel sauce, in a medium saucepan, heat the sugar over a medium heat. Do not stir it and let it slowly caramelise, take care as the sugar will be extremely hot. It will start browning around the edges of the pan first. Meanwhile in another plan, slowly warm the butter and cream. With the sugar pan, gently swirl the sugar around the pan to ensure the caramel cooks evenly. Once the sugar has caramelised to a golden-brown colour, carefully add a small amount of the cream. Take care as it will bubble vigorously. Stir constantly. Add the remaining cream, bit by bit.  Bring to a boil on a low heat and simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce becomes smooth and thick. Sprinkle in the salt and pour the sauce into a serving jug.  For the caramelised pecans, line a baking tray  with non-stick baking paper. Dissolve the sugar in a pan to make a dark caramel. Take care as the mixture will be extremely hot. Lay the pecans on the prepared tray and carefully pour the caramel over the pecans. Leave to set. Top the loaf with the caramelised pecans and serve with the salted caramel sauce ","ingredients":" 450g\/1lb plain flour, plus extra for dusting,  80g\/3oz good-quality cocoa powder,  ½ tsp sea salt,  1 tsp baking powder,  1 tsp baking soda,  50g\/1¾oz pecan nuts, chopped,  115g\/4oz unsalted butter, softened,  200g\/7oz caster sugar,  200ml\/7fl oz buttermilk,  2 large free-range eggs,  50g\/1¾oz sugar,  10g\/¼oz unsalted butter,  120ml\/4fl oz whipping cream,  ½ tsp flaked sea salt,  200g\/7fl oz caster sugar,  20 pecan nuts, shelled","vegetarian":true,"calories":null,"protein":null,"carbs":null,"sugars":null,"total_fat":null,"saturated_fat":null,"fiber":null,"salt":null,"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/chocolate_quick_breads_07222"}
