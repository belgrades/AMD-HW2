Remove the fish from the pan and set aside to rest. Heat the butter in a separate frying pan, add the shallots and fry for a few minutes. One it has reached the nut brown stage (or beurre noisette), add the lemon juice, capers, gentleman’s relish, parsley and shrimps and cook for a couple of minutes. For the wilted spinach, in the same pan you fried your fish, heat the butter, add the spinach and a tablespoon of water and cook until wilted. Finish with a grating of fresh nutmeg. To serve, place some spinach in the centre of each serving plate and top with the fish. Spoon the sauce over and around the fish. Garnish with watercress and lemon flowers.
