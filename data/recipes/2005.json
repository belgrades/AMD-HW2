Add the onion, carrot, chilli, ginger and chopped coriander and mix together until well combined.  Gradually add the beaten egg and breadcrumbs and mix together until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Divide the mixture equally into four. Roll each into balls about the size of a tennis ball. Flatten slightly, using the palms of your hands, into patties about 2cm\/1in thick. (NB: Make sure all the burgers are the same thickness.) Transfer the burgers to a plate, cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to one hour. Preheat the grill to its highest setting, or heat the barbecue until hot.  Brush the burgers all over with vegetable oil, then grill for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on both sides.  To serve, slice the buns in half and place one burger inside each. Top with your choice of accompaniment.
