Place the pepper halves onto a baking tray, drizzle with one tablespoon of the oil and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until softened. Once the peppers are cooked, remove them from the oven and set aside.  Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a non-stick pan. Add the cumin seeds and fry for 20-30 seconds, or until fragrant.  Add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown.  Add the tomatoes, ginger, peas, beans, salt and spices and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened and reduced to a pulp. Add the crumbled paneer and the water and stir until well combined. Bring the mixture to a simmer and simmer for 2-3 minutes.  Add the double cream and season well with freshly ground black pepper. Simmer until heated through.  Add the chopped coriander and continue to simmer the mixture for 4-5 minutes, adding tablespoons of water as necessary to stop the sauce from drying out as the paneer absorbs the liquid. Preheat the grill to its highest setting. While the grill is heating up, fill each of the baked pepper halves with the paneer mixture. When the grill is hot, grill the stuffed peppers until the paneer mixture is golden-brown.  To serve, place one or two stuffed pepper halves onto each serving plate. Spoon a portion of basmati rice alongside each.
