Turn each drumstick upside-down and chop the bottom of the bone off, then push the meat down towards the bottom of the bone so that it looks like a little ball at the bottom of the drumstick. Using a pair of tweezers, pull the tendons from the bone and discard. Set the drumsticks aside. In a bowl, stir 100ml\/3½fl oz of the yoghurt with all of the remaining drumstick ingredients until well combined. Add the remaining yoghurt and mix through.  Add the drumsticks to the yoghurt marinade and wiggle them around until they are completely coated in the marinade. Cover the bowl with cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or overnight. When the drumsticks have marinated, preheat the oven to 200C\/180C Fan\/Gas 6. Remove the drumsticks from the marinade, shaking off any excess. Sit them bone upright on a baking tray, then roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the marinade has browned and the chicken is cooked through at its thickest part and no trace of pink remains. Meanwhile, for the raita, in a bowl, mix together the chilli, garlic and cucumber.  Stir in the cumin, mint and coriander.  Add the yoghurt and lime juice, stir well, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Chill in the fridge until ready to serve. To serve, pile the drumsticks onto a large serving plate, bones facing upwards. Spoon the raita into a bowl and place it alongside for everyone to serve themselves.
