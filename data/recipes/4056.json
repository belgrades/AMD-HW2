Add the cumin seeds and dry fry for three minutes, or until just turning a darker brown. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Place the yoghurt, water, turmeric, chilli powder, ground coriander, ground cumin, salt and sugar into a bowl and mix well. Add the yoghurt mixture to the pan of toasted cumin seeds. Return to the heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for three minutes.  Add the whole chillies and the par-boiled potato cubes and simmer for 8-10 minutes, until the potatoes are completely cooked through. For the grey mullet, season the mullet fillets well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the oil in a frying pan and, when hot, add the mullet fillets and cook for two minutes on each side. Add the butter to the pan and allow to melt and foam. Spoon the pan juices over the mullet fillets and cook until the fish is completely cooked through. To serve, spoon some of the potatoes and their sauce onto each plate. Place a mullet fillet on top of each pile of potatoes and garnish with fresh coriander leaves and lime wedges.
