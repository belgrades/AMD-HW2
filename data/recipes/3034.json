{"recipe_name":"Custard with thyme","author":"James Martin","programme":"Sweet Baby James","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Makes 750ml","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl until well blended. Chop the fresh thyme finely and place into a pan, along with the milk and cream. Bring to the boil. Once the milk and cream have reached boiling point, take off the heat. Pour a little of the milk and cream onto the eggs and sugar and mix well. Pour back into the pan. Return to the heat and, using a whisk, lightly stir to thicken. Do not boil. As the egg yolks warm, the cream will thicken to a custard. Keep stirring with a wooden spoon until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and pass through a sieve into a clean saucepan, discarding the thyme leaves. Leave to cool, stirring occasionally until it cools completely. The custard can be served cold or hot.
