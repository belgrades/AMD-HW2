Press the breadcrumbs onto both sides of the fish. Heat a little oil in a pan and fry the halibut steaks over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Set aside in a warm place. For the sauce, heat the oil in the same pan used to cook the fish, add the shallots, garlic and ginger and fry gently for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until they begin to burst open, then add the red wine vinegar, sugar, ketchup and fish sauce and simmer for 2-3 minutes. To serve, place the halibut steaks onto serving plates and spoon over the sauce. Garnish with coriander and shredded spring onions and serve with jasmine rice.
