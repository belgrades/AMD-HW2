For the sea bass, heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the sea bass, skin-side down, for 3-4 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Turn the sea bass fillet over and fry for a further 3-4 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and golden-brown and the fish is cooked through.

Reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering and poach the leeks for 8-10 minutes, or until tender. Drain the leeks then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, spoon the tomato sauce over the fried sea bass. Serve the poached leeks alongside with a dollop of pesto.
