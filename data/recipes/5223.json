Add the melted butter and mix well. Sift the flour, baking powder, caster sugar and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and gradually stir in the buttermilk mixture until the dry ingredients are just moistened, being careful not to overmix. Place the egg whites in a dry, clean bowl and beat until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the egg whites into the batter using a large metal spoon. Melt a small portion of butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and drop two tablespoons of batter per cake into the pan.   Cook the cake until golden brown on the underside and looking dry at the edges, then turn and cook the other side.   Transfer to a plate and keep warm while cooking the remaining batter. Toss the fresh strawberries with the honey and a light dusting of icing sugar.  Dust the lemon soufflé cakes with extra icing sugar and serve with the strawberries.
