{"recipe_name":"Black pudding with a poached egg, crispy pig’s ears and spicy tomato chutney","author":"Michel Roux Jr.","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the crispy pig’s ears, place the pig’s ears in a large saucepan with the onion, carrot, celery and peppercorns. Season with salt and add enough water to cover the ingredients. Cook on a medium heat for 1½-2 hours. When cooked, drain the pig’s ears and set aside to dry. Preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Mix the two flours together, add salt and pepper and mix well. Cut the ears into strips and dredge in the flour. Transfer to the fryer and cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove using a slotted spoon and leave to drain on kitchen paper. For the spicy tomato chutney, put the shallots and garlic in a sauté pan or frying pan. Add the sugar, chilli flakes, salt, pepper and vinegar. Bring to the boil, then add the tomatoes and raisins. Cook for a further 10-15 minutes until the tomatoes have softened. Set aside. For the black pudding and poached egg, bring a pan of water to the boil, add a splash of white wine vinegar, stir the water and crack in the eggs one by one. Poach until the whites are set and the yolks soft (about 1-2 minutes). Remove using a slotted spoon and drain. In the meantime heat a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Add the black pudding and cook on each side until crisp and cooked through. Add the butter at the end and baste the black pudding. To serve, place a spoonful of tomato chutney on the serving plates and put the black pudding on top. Top with a poached egg and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with the crispy pig’s ears.
