Place all the marinated pork ingredients, except the pork fillet and olive oil, into a bowl and mix well. Add the pork fillets and turn to coat in the marinade, then leave to marinate for 20-30 minutes.   Drain any excess marinade from the pork and heat a frying pan until hot. Heat the olive oil and add the pork fillet and fry for 1-2 minutes on both side. Transfer to the oven and roast for 8-10 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the heat and leave to rest in a warm place for five minutes. For the tzatziki, mix the cucumber and salt together and allow to sit in a colander for one hour, then rinse and pat dry with kitchen paper. Place the cucumber into a bowl. Add the yoghurt, garlic and mint and stir to combine. Season, to taste, with salt and black pepper. For the romesco sauce, place the pepper, onion, chillies and olive oil onto a roasting tray and place into the oven for 10-12 minutes, until soft and browned. Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot, then place the tomatoes, cut-side down, into the pan and sear until blackened. Place the roasted vegetables, ground almonds, vinegar, anchovies and bread into a food processor and blend for two minutes, until smooth. With the food processor still running, gradually add 125ml\/4½fl oz olive oil in a steady stream until completely incorporated into the sauce, then season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, slice the pork fillet and place onto a plate. Place a spoonful of romesco to one side of pork, and a spoonful of the tzatziki to the other side.
