Add the stock, honey, orange juice and zest to a saucepan and simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced to a glaze. Season the partridges with salt and pepper and lay the lardo (or pancetta) strips over the breasts. Place on an oven tray and brush with the glaze. Roast for 15 minutes or until cooked through and the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part of the meat. Brush the partridges with more of the glaze as they roast. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Once hot, add the chicory, sprinkle over the sugar and fry until they start to caramelise. Add a splash of water and the remaining glaze and cook the chicories until just tender. Keep warm until ready to serve. Heat the milk in a large saucepan. When it comes to the boil, whisk in the polenta and season generously with salt and pepper. Stir, reduce the heat and gently cook the polenta for 5–6 minutes. Add the Parmesan and butter and stir until melted. Add the segmented orange to the glazed chicory. To serve, finish the polenta with lots of oregano and spoon onto serving plates. Top with the chicory. Remove the breasts and legs from the partridges and carve. Divide the partridge between the plates and finish with the remaining glaze and orange segments.
