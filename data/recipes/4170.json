Crumble in the feta (large chunks are fine as they will break up slightly when everything is stirred together in the bowl). Season, to taste, with freshly ground black pepper and lemon juice and mix everything together gently. Heat a griddle pan until hot, season the lamb cutlets with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and brush each cutlet with a little olive oil before placing on the hot griddle. Cook for a few minutes one each side, or until lightly crisp - I like mine still pink and a little springy in the middle. Divide the cutlets between a two warm plates, and while the cutlets are still sizzling, gently spoon over the feta and herb dressing. Eat immediately, while all is hot, herbal and piquant.
