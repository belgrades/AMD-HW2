{"recipe_name":"Potato rosti with poached egg","author":"James Tanner","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Line a bowl with a clean tea towel and grate the new potatoes into the bowl. Twist the tea towel to squeeze out the excess moisture from the potatoes into the bowl.  Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan, add the grated potatoes to the pan and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry the potatoes for 5-6 minutes, or until they come together to form a cake, adding a little butter down the sides of the rösti every two minutes.  Turn the rösti over using a fish slice and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, again adding a little butter down the sides to crispen the edges. Remove the rösti from the pan when golden-brown and drain on kitchen paper.  To serve, cut the rösti into quarters and place a poached egg on top.
