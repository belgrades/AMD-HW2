Press the powder onto one side of the chicken breast.  Heat the butter and olive oil over a medium heat, and fry the coated chicken for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked through and golden-brown. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.) For the leeks, place the leeks and butter into a saucepan along with three tablespoons of boiling water, and cover with the lid. Cook on a medium heat for two minutes, or until softened.  Remove the lid and heat for a further 2-3 minutes until the liquid thickens.  Stir in the cream and simmer over a gentle heat for 3-4 minutes, then stir in the tarragon and seasoning.  To serve, spoon the creamy leeks onto a plate and place the chicken on top of them.
