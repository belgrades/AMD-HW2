Lightly grease two baking trays. Knock the dough back to its original size and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough into eight portions, shape them into rounds and place onto the baking trays. Ensure the rolls are well spaced. Cover with a tea towel and set aside to prove for 30 minutes.
