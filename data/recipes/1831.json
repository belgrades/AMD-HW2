{"recipe_name":"Chicken liver pâté with figs, chutney and ciabatta toast","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 6 - 8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the chicken liver pâté preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Place the chicken livers into a large roasting tray in a single layer. Dot with 50g\/2oz of the butter. Pour over the Madeira and sprinkle over the tarragon leaves. Roast in the oven for 4-5 minutes, or until the livers are cooked on the outside but pink inside. Blend the chicken livers in a food processor with the remaining 250g\/9oz butter to a smooth purée. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then spoon the pâté into a 23 x 12cm\/9 x 4½in loaf tin lined with cling film and smooth the top with a palette knife. Place the bay leaf, thyme sprigs and chives on top of the pâté, then pour over the clarified butter. Tap the sides of the dish gently to ensure that the surface of the pâté is evenly covered in clarified butter and any air bubbles are released. Chill in the fridge for two hours, or until set. Remove the pâté from the fridge 20 minutes before serving. For the chutney, heat the oil in a medium sauce pan. Once hot add the shallot and gently fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the rosemary, sultana, raisins and sugar and fry until the fruit begins to caramelise. Add the rest of the ingredients, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes. For the salad, place the leaves and cut figs in a bowl. Whisk the oil, vinegar and mustard in a small bowl to combine. To serve, heat a grill until hot, and drizzle the oil on the bread. Toast the bread for 1-2 minutes on each side.  Remove the pâté from the cling filmed tin and peel off the cling film.  Take two tablespoons, and shape the pâté into a quenelle. Place the pâté on the plate. Place the chutney on the side and the ciabatta next to it. Dress the salad and place on the plate.
