Pack the turkey paste into four small kilner jars or ramekins and smooth the surface over. Pour over the melted butter to cover the paste completely, then place into the fridge overnight. For the chutney, heat the oil in a non-reactive pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion until softened. Add the beetroot wedges and chilli and stir well to combine. Add the sugar and vinegar and bring to boil. Boil for 10-15 minutes, or until the beetroot wedges are soft. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fold in the gherkins and cranberries. Leave to cool. To serve, place a jar (or ramekin) of the potted turkey onto each plate with a teaspoon to serve and place a dollop of chutney alongside. Serve with slices of griddled or toasted sourdough bread.
