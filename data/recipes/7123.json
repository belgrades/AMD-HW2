For the dumplings, place two teaspoons of the filling mixture into the centre of one of the wanton wrappers. Gather up the sides of the wonton wrapper and mould around the filling into a ball shape, leaving the filling in the centre exposed. Repeat with the remaining wrappers, until the filling is used up. Top each with a goji berry, if using. Oil the bottom of a bamboo steamer and line with greaseproof paper. Place the dumplings in the steamer, cover with a lid and place over a pan of boiling water (making sure the water does not touch the base of the steamer). Steam the dumplings for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through. Combine the chilli and soy sauce in a bowl and serve with the dumplings.
