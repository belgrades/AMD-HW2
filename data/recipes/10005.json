Place the butter and the caster sugar into a bowl and beat together until light and creamy. Add the sunflower oil and brown sugar and fold through to combine. Add the egg and vanilla essence and mix well. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt and baking powder. Add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar mixture and mix well to form a dough. Add the drained cherries and brandy and fold into the dough. Fold in the almonds, hazelnuts and the white and dark chocolate pieces. On a floured work surface, carefully roll out the dough to 1cm\/½in thick. Using the cookie cutter of your choice, cut out 8-16 cookies (depending on the size of the cutter). Place the cookies onto a greased baking tray (not too close together as they will spread). Place into the oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the trays for 8-10 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
