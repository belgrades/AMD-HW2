{"recipe_name":"Limed queen scallops flambéed in tequila","author":"The Hairy Bikers","programme":"The Hairy Bikers","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Heat the olive oil and butter in a heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium heat. Add the shallots and sweat gently - do not allow to brown. Add the lime juice and zest and cook for a minute or two. Add the sugar and stir continuously - it's important to keep the ingredients moving around the pan at this point to prevent the sugar from burning. Increase the heat to high then add the scallops. Fry for another minute. Add a big glug of tequila and the chopped chives and flambé - if cooking on gas carefully let the flame just catch the pan or if using an electric hob you might need to use a match to ignite the tequila (CAUTION: Take care when flambéing the scallops and keep your face well away from the pan. If you're not an experienced cook you must be aware that this method of cooking can create large flames). If the tequila doesn't light quickly then don't be tempted to keep the pan on the heat any longer as this will overcook the scallops. Serve the scallops hot from the pan and in warm tortilla wraps or with lemon butter rice.
