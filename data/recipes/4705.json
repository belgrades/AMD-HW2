Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes. Add all of the berries and remove from the heat. Allow to cool. Strain the fruit mixture over a bowl. Place the drained berries into a separate bowl and reserve the fruit syrup. Cut each slice of bread in half and dip the pieces into the fruit syrup. Use the syrup-soaked bread to line the insides of four small dariole moulds. Spoon some of the reserved berries into each bread-lined mould, to fill by one third. Add a layer of syrup-soaked bread, then spoon in more berries and top with a final layer of syrup-soaked bread. Place into the fridge to chill overnight. To serve, turn out the puddings from the moulds onto plates and dust with icing sugar. Add a dollop of clotted cream alongside, if using, then serve.
