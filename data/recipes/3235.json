Remove the tendon from the duck breast to prevent the meat shrinking during cooking.  Place cumin, honey and oil in a hot non-stick pan and heat until foaming and nut brown.  Place the pre-prepared duck, skin side down, into the pan and season well. Cook the breast until the skin is dark brown and crisp. It is important to colour the skin at this stage as it will not colour in the oven. It also removes some of the fat.  Turn the duck over in the pan, or remove to a baking tray, and place in the oven. Cook for 5-6 minutes for medium, 8-12 minutes for well done.  Remove the duck and let it rest.  While the duck is cooking, spoon about 6 tbspof plum sauce into the centre of a serving plate and scatter the crispy seaweed around the edge.  Slice the duck and lay it on the pool of sauce. Serve with rice or noodles.
