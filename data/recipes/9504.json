Place a baking sheet into the oven. Place the milk, cornflour and butter into a small saucepan and whisk together over a gentle heat. Add two-thirds of the Port Salut and whisk until melted.

Add the spinach and cook for a further minute. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then pour into a food processor and blend until almost smooth. Add the spinach mixture to the cheese mixture and stir gently. In a large clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.
