Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then remove from the heat. Cut each sheet of filo pastry into 4 even-sized rectangles and brush each rectangle lightly with the melted butter. Spread one tablespoon of the chocolate spread, as evenly as possible, across the long side of each piece of pastry, keeping a 2cm\/¾ in border. Fold the two short sides of the pastry over the filling to seal the chocolate spread. Roll up the pastry from the long side, to fully enclose the filling.   Repeat with the remaining rectangles of filo pastry to make 12 rolls. Place the rolls on the lined baking tray and brush them with a little more melted butter, then bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes or until the pastry is a pale golden brown. Remove the rolls from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack. For the vanilla cream dip, whip the cream very lightly with the sugar and vanilla extract.  Spoon into a small serving bowl.  To serve, dust the chocolate filo rolls with a little sifted icing sugar, and arrange them onto a serving plate with the vanilla cream dip placed alongside.
