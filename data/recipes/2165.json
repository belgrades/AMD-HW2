Line a 24cm\/9Â½in loose-based, spring-form cake tin with baking parchment. Place the chocolate and butter into a bowl and place on top of a pan of boiling water. Heat the chocolate and butter until melted, and stir to combine. Place the egg yolks into a bowl with two tablespoons of the sugar and whisk lightly. Place the egg whites into a separate bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining sugar, continually whisking until firm peaks are formed. Pour the melted chocolate onto the egg yolks and beat in. Add one-third of the egg whites to the chocolate mixture and beat in to lighten the mixture. Gently fold the remaining egg whites into the mixture, making sure it is all incorporated. Pour the mixture into the cake tin then place in the oven for 20 minutes, until just set. Set aside to cool. For the Pimms roasted rhubarb, place the rhubarb onto a tray and scatter the sugar over the top. Pour the Pimms over then toss to coat and place into the oven for 15 minutes until just tender and glazed in the Pimms.  To serve, slice the cake and place on the plate along with a little pile of rhubarb and a scoop of ice cream.
