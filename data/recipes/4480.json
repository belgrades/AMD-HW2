Carefully remove from the pan and mould around a rolling pin to create a curled shape. Leave to cool. For the Quorn, place the soy sauce, honey and Quorn into a small bowl, stir well and leave to marinate for ten minutes. Drain, reserving the marinating liquid. Heat the olive oil in a wok and fry the Quorn for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown. Add the pepper and tomato and cook for 2-3 minutes, then add the marinating liquid and spinach. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for a further 1-2 minutes, then spoon into a serving bowl.  To serve, top the glazed Quorn with the cheesy crisp.
