Remove from the heat and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Meanwhile, rub the steaks all over with the remaining vegetable oil and season well. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. When the pan is hot, add the steaks and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Transfer to a warm plate and set aside to rest for 5-10 minutes. Season the sauce, to taste, then stir through the parsley and the remaining butter.
