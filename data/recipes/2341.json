Bash the biscuits into pieces using a rolling pin. (Put them in a plastic bag first so they don't go everywhere!) Melt chocolate, butter and golden syrup in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally. Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the broken biscuits, apricots, raisins, pecans and marshmallows. Spoon the mixture into the bowl, pushing down well to minimise air pockets.  Leave to cool, then put in the fridge overnight to set. The next day, place the pudding bowl in a dish of hot water for a few seconds to loosen it from the pudding bowl. Place upside down on a serving plate.  Melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Allow to cool and thicken slightly before pouring some on the top of the pudding and gently pushing down to form a custard shape.  Top with the glacé cherries and holly and serve.
