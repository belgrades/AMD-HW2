{"recipe_name":"Deep-fried poached eggs with creamed spinach","author":"Mary Ann Gilchrist","programme":"Yes Chef","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Bring a wide, shallow pan of water to the boil and add the vinegar. Crack four eggs into individual cups. Stir the boiling water to create a ‘whirlpool’. Pour in the eggs one by one. Bring the water back to the boil and cook the eggs for 2½ minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon and plunge them into a bowl of iced water. Leave to chill until required.  In a large frying pan or wok, melt the butter and add the spinach. Cook over a high heat for 2 minutes, or until just wilting. Stir in the cream, reduce the heat, then season with salt and pepper. Put the flour in a small bowl. Beat the two remaining eggs in a second bowl. Mix the breadcrumbs and cheese together in a third bowl. Carefully remove each poached egg from the iced water and pat dry with kitchen paper.  Gently coat each egg in the flour, then the egg and then the cheese and breadcrumb mixture. Place on a baking tray and cover with cling film. Put in the fridge for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, heat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 180C (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)  Deep fry the eggs for 2—3 minutes, or until brown and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.  Meanwhile, reheat the spinach and divide between four warmed bowls. Top with the eggs and garnish with crispy bacon and a few drops of truffle oil.
