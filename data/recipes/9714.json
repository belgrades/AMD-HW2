Add the bay leaves and soy sauce and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer with the lid on for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of the ribs. Meanwhile, combine the marinade ingredients in a pan. Simmer over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then boil for 5 minutes to thicken slightly. Leave to cool then transfer to a shallow dish.  Drain the ribs, add them to the marinade and turn to coat in the sauce. As soon as the ribs are cool, cover and chill in the fridge, ideally overnight, turning occasionally. Light the barbecue about 30 minutes before you want to eat, so that the flames have died down, the coals are covered in grey ash and producing a steady heat.   Lift the ribs out of the marinade 20 minutes before cooking to come to room temperature. Reserve about 150ml\/5fl oz of the liquid for basting and boil the rest to produce a sticky glaze, taking care that it doesnâ€™t burn.
