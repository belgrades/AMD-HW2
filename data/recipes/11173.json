Heat a wok until smoking and add the groundnut oil. Add the fish, pressing down lightly on the pieces of fish as they cook. Cook for 3-4 minutes on one side, then reduce the heat to medium. Turn the fish over and sprinkle over the garlic, ginger and chilli. Cook for a further 3-4 minutes (depending on the size of the fillet), or until the flesh has turned opaque and flakes easily when poked with a pair of chopsticks or a fork. Season with the soy sauce and sesame oil and spoon the sauce over the fish. Add the spring onion strips and chopped coriander and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the herbs have wilted slightly.  To serve, transfer the fish to a serving plate and garnish with the wilted herbs. Spoon over the cooking juices from the pan and serve immediately with steamed rice or dressed wholewheat noodles and steamed asparagus and broccoli.
