Blend the poppadums in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle the mixture onto a plate. Sprinkle the flour onto a separate plate. Beat the egg in a bowl. Dip the chicken first in the flour, then in the beaten egg and finally in the breadcrumb mixture. Heat 5cm\/2in oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Fry the chicken in the oil for 4-5 minutes, turning once. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and place onto a baking tray. Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)  Stir the chopped coriander into the rice. To serve, spoon the rice onto a plate and top with the poppadum-crusted chicken. Sprinkle over the chives and add Tabasco sauce, to taste.
