Give the liquid mixture a quick whisk before incorporating the flour. Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter. Now add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and whisk thoroughly.  Take a crêpe pan, or large frying pan, dip some kitchen roll in the oil and carefully wipe the inside of the pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat for a minute. Add just under a ladleful of batter to the pan and immediately start swirling it round the pan to get a nice even layer.  Cook the pancake for approximately 30-40 seconds. Use a palette knife to lift the pancake carefully to look at the underside to check it is golden-brown before turning over. Cook the other side for approx 30-40 seconds and transfer to a serving plate.
