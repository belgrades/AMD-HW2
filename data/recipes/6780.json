Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes. Add the vegetables, Scotch bonnet chillies, coconut milk and butter beans to the pan and stir well to combine. Return the mixture to a simmer and continue to cook, covered, for a further 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, for the spillers dumplings, in a large bowl, mix together the flour and salt. Add the water, little by little, stirring until the mixture comes together as a smooth dough. Set aside. After the stew has cooked for 20 minutes, add the callaloo or spinach, stir well, and continue to simmer the mixture for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile, pinch 20-24 small pieces from the dough and roll each into a ball, using up all of the dough. Add each dumpling to the pot immediately after rolling it and replace the lid. Continue to simmer the stew and dumplings for 8-10 minutes, or until the meat and vegetables are tender, the sauce has thickened and the dumplings are cooked through.
