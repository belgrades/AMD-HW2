{"recipe_name":"Turkey and vegetable stew","author":"Colin McGurran","programme":"Great British Budget Menu","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Heat a large saucepan over a high heat. Add the oil, season the turkey leg on all sides and brown in the hot pan for 7-8 minutes, turning now and again to ensure that all sides are coloured. Turn the heat down to medium and add the onions, garlic and carrots and stir.   Pour in the stock, mixing well to combine. Reduce the heat so that the stock is simmering gently. Cover with a lid and cook for one hour, stirring occasionally. Once the turkey leg is cooked, remove it from the stew and leave to one side to cool slightly. Add the potatoes to the stew, cover again and continue to cook for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Meanwhile once cool enough to handle, remove the skin from the turkey and use a fork to help shred the meat, discarding any bones or sinew. Add the meat back to the pan with the cooked potatoes and stew mixture. Mix well, taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Once ready to serve, stir through the chopped parsley and serve hot.
