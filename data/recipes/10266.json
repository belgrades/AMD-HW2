{"recipe_name":"Tequila chillies","author":"Kitty Hope and Mark Greenwood","programme":"Sweets Made Simple","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Makes 8 chocolate-filled chillies","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/food\/ic\/food_16x9_608\/recipes\/tequila_chillies_40712_16x9.jpg","method":"Cut a slit lengthways down the middle of each chilli and carefully take out the seeds. (You may want to wear rubber gloves for this.)  Put the chillies in a sealable container and add two tablespoons of the tequila. Leave to soak for 48 hours. The soaking takes the sting out of the chillies. Heat 5cm\/2in water in a pan. Put a heatproof bowl on top of the pan, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Place the cream and 50g\/1¾oz white chocolate in the bowl. Place over a gentle heat to allow the chocolate to melt.  Take the bowl off the heat and add the remaining tablespoon of tequila, the lime zest and juice and the butter. Whisk everything until it becomes a smooth ganache, pour into a sealable container, then chill overnight to set.  When you are ready to fill the chillies, take a teaspoon and scoop up about half a teaspoon of ganache and stuff it into the chillies. Put them into the fridge to chill.  To temper the remaining white chocolate, put the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water, ensuring the base of the bowl doesn’t touch the water or the chocolate will burn. Take care also to not let any water into the chocolate or the chocolate will seize. Using a chocolate thermometer bring it up to 42C\/107F, then take the bowl off the heat and allow to cool down to 27C\/81F. Dip each chilli in the chocolate to cover, then sprinkle each with a little sea salt. Set them aside on a baking sheet covered with baking parchment, and leave in the fridge to set. Serve them whole or cut into slices.
