Bring to the boil and cook for 10–15 minutes, until cooked through. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid. For the sauce verte, bring a pan of water to the boil and blanch the spinach and watercress. Remove, plunge into ice-cold water and drain.  Put the spinach, watercress and herbs in a blender and blend until fine. Add the mayonnaise and lemon juice and blend until bright green. Season with salt and pepper. For the salmon, heat a griddle pan to a very high heat, sear the salmon for 3–4 minutes on both sides. Remove the skin before serving. Just before serving, crush the potatoes with a fork adding any reserved liquid to make them as moist as you like. Serve the salmon on top of the potatoes and dribble the sauce verte over.
