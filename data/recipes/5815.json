{"recipe_name":"Monkfish, Israeli couscous, sea vegetables and chorizo","author":"Aggi Sverrisson","programme":"Saturday Kitchen Best Bites","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the Israeli couscous, place your couscous into a pan with the salt, olive oil and 100ml\/3½fl oz water. Bring to boil and then remove from the heat, cover with cling film and allow to steam for 10 minutes. Once the couscous is cooked, add few drops of lemon juice, nuts and chopped herbs and stir through. Cover again with cling film and keep warm. For the monkfish and chorizo, heat two non-stick pans with a little oil. Season the monkfish with a little salt, then place into the hot pan skin-side down and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown. Turn over, add the lemon juice and leave in the pan for one minute to rest. At the same time, cook the chorizos in the other pan, placing them cut-side down, without any seasoning. For the sea vegetables, bring a small pan of unsalted water to the boil. Add the sea vegetables and cook for 30 seconds, then remove and drain. For the olive oil sauce, in a small pan gently warm the olive oil, parsley, chives, green olives and lemon juice. This will take about two minutes. To serve, put 3-4 tablespoons of the couscous into each serving bowl, place the monkfish on top and then sit a piece of chorizo on top of that. Arrange the sea vegetables around and over the fish. Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the olive oil sauce over the fish and serve.
