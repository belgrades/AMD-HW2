In the same pan heat another 15g\/½oz butter, add the shallot, thyme and garlic, and cook over a moderate heat until the shallot is soft but not coloured.  Add the brandy, anchovy essence and pepper, and scrape the bottom of the pan to release any coagulated juices.  Place everything in the food processor, including the remaining unsalted butter. Blend until smooth. If you want a very smooth pâté, pass the mixture through a fine sieve and put in a bowl. Cover with the cling film, cool then refrigerate. If not using within 48 hours, cover the top with clarified butter.
