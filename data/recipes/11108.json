Grease a large piece of foil with butter. Using a sharp knife make three slashes along each side of the fish, and push a little chopped coriander into the slashes. Place the coriander stalks into the cavity of the fish. Season all over with salt and pepper. Wrap the fish in foil to make a parcel. Make sure the seam of the parcel is to the side, so you can turn the fish upside down. Bake for about 30 minutes, turning over after 15 minutes, until cooked through.
