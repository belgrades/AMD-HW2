Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes then cover with cling film and allow to steam in a warm place until the quinoa has cooled. Place the cooled quinoa in a large mixing bowl. Heat a frying pan until medium hot, add one tablespoon of the oil, the reserved quinoa, dill seed, fennel seed, cumin seed and ground cinnamon and toast for one minute. Pour the mixture onto the cooked quinoa then stir in the herbs. Mix well and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Toss the winter leaves with a little of the quinoa, the balsamic vinegar and the last of the olive oil. For the ling, preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Season the ling well with salt. Heat a non-stick frying pan until hot, add the olive oil. Add the ling and cook on each side until lightly golden-brown.  Remove the ling from the pan, and place onto a baking tray.  Bake in the oven for 3-4 minutes. Remove the baking tray from the oven and season the ling with a little salt and lemon juice.  Place the yoghurt into a bowl and season, to taste, with lemon juice and salt. Mix well. For the grapefruit and prawn dressing, place the grapefruit juice, olive oil, 25ml\/1fl oz water and salt into a jug and stir until the salt dissolves. Pour the dressing into a small saucepan and heat through, then add the prawns, parsley and capers. To serve, spoon lemon yoghurt around 4 plates, and place a pile of quinoa in the centre of each plate. Top with a piece of ling, and spoon the grapefruit and prawn dressing over the top. Serve the salad leaves alongside.
