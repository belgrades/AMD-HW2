Mix the coconut milk and stock together and pour it over the washed rice. Cover the saucepan with a lid and bring the rice to boil on high heat. Once vigorously boiling, change to a low heat, cover with the lid and allow to simmer for 10 minutes, or until the water level is the same as the top of the rice. At this point, turn the heat completely off and allow to rest for a further 10 minutes, keeping the lid on at all times. Use a wooden spoon to fluff up the rice before serving. Add salt, sugar and pepper to taste.
