Using a cheese grater, gently grate the hard-boiled eggs into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the tarragon, capers, mustard and garlic. Now add the olive oil and red wine vinegar with salt and pepper to taste, and mix well. Place to one side or chill in the refrigerator. Butterfly each chicken breast by cutting through the middle horizontally as if you were cutting open a bap. Then cut each of the halves lengthways into four strips.  Place the chicken in a large mixing bowl. Mix the dried herbs and spices with the pepper and oil, throw this mixture into the bowl and make sure all the chicken is well coated. Preheat a hot grill. Thread the meat lengthways on 16 skewers, preferably wooden, so you have long pieces of meat on your  skewers like chicken satay, leaving enough room at one end of the skewer for you to hold.  Lay some foil over your grill tray, place the skewered chicken on the foil and drizzle lightly with olive oil.  Cook under the hot grill for 4-5 minutes, turn over and grill for a further 3-4r minutes.  Serve on a large dish with the long end of the skewer facing outwards. Spoon over the salsa and finish with a twist of black pepper.
