Place a layer of crab mixture into each chefs' ring over the tomatoes and smooth over. Sprinkle over the chopped chives to cover the crabmeat mixture. Mix the brown crabmeat with the smoked paprika and a squeeze of lemon, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon a layer of the brown crabmeat mixture over the top of each layer of chives. Repeat the layering process with the remaining white crabmeat mixture, chives and brown crabmeat mixture until the ring is full.
