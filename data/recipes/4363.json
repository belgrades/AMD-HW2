{"recipe_name":"Herb-crusted rack of lamb","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 120C\/250F\/Gas 1. Make the herb crust. Lay the ciabatta, lemon rind, capers, anchovies, onions and olives on a baking sheet. Place them in the oven to dry out for two hours. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and whiz with the herbs until fine breadcrumbs form, about two minutes. Turn the oven up to 180c\/355F\/Gas 4. Season the lamb and then warm a large heavy based frying pan. Add enough oil to cover the base and seal the lamb on the side with the fat, about two minutes. Brush the lamb with mustard so that it is completely covered and then roll it in the herb crust. Place the meat in a shallow baking dish and bake in the oven until medium rare, about 12 minutes, turning halfway through. Remove from the oven and leave to rest. While the lamb is cooking, warm a frying pan and add the pancetta and then the artichoke wedges. Season well. Stir in the courgettes, fava beans and mint leaves and add a little warmed beef stock to bring the mixture together. Keep warm. To serve, cut the lamb rack into cutlets. On each plate arrange a few cutlets on a bed of the vegetable mixture.  Drizzle beef stock around the outside of each plate and serve.
