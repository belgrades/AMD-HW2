Meanwhile, place the mango, tomato, red onion, chilli and lime juice into a separate bowl and mix to combine. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside until ready to serve. Heat a frying pan until hot and add the olive oil. Add the marinated John Dory fillets, flesh-side down and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until caramelised and the fish is just cooked through.
