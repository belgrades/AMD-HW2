Place the butter into a food processor and blend until it is fluffy and white. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot add the Parma ham, button mushrooms, garlic, shallots, fennel and herbs and cook for 2-3 minutes. Allow to cool.  Add the cooled mixture to the blended butter along with the mustard, breadcrumbs, cooked lobster coral and ground almonds. Mix thoroughly and roll in cling film into a log shape and place in the fridge. Blanch the lobster in salted water for 1½ minutes, then cut in half. Remove the meat from the claws, knuckles and tails, reserving the body shells in tact. Place the meat back into the half-shell and onto a baking tray. Unwrap the herb butter and slice into eight rounds. Place two slices of the butter on each half of lobster. Bake the lobsters in the oven for 4-5 minutes, until hot and bubbling. Meanwhile, for the samphire, heat a medium frying pan and add the butter. Once melted add the samphire and cook for a couple of minutes.
