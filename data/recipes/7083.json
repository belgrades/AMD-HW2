Bring a pot of salted water to the boil and parboil the potatoes for 10 minutes, or until just tender. Drain well and set aside.  Blanch the leeks in another pan of boiling water for 5 minutes until tender, then drain well. Put the potatoes and leeks in a large bowl. Heat a saucepan and briefly fry the garlic and anchovies in the olive oil, then add the cream and cook gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add to the bowl and gently mix with the potatoes and leeks. Season with salt and pepper. Put the leek and potato mixture in a baking dish. Cover with aluminium foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil. Scatter the breadcrumbs over the surface, then return to the oven for 5-10 minutes, or until browned on top. When the potato and leek bake has been returned to the oven start preparing the chops. Preheat the grill to medium-high. Mix together the rosemary, most of the lemon juice, the olive oil and season with a little salt and pepper. Rub the mixture on both sides of the chops. Grill the chops for 3 minutes on each side. Remove from the heat and leave to rest for 1 minute, then sprinkle with the rest of the lemon juice and a dash of olive oil.  Serve the chops immediately, with the potato and leek al forno alongside.
