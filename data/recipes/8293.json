Cover with fresh water and set aside to soak. This produces fluffier, softer rice and ensures that each grain remains separate. Crush the saffron lightly in a pestle and mortar, then pour over the orange flower water and set aside to soak. Heat the butter and oil in a large lidded pan and fry the shallots over a high heat until dark brown and crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Lower the heat and fry the spices and nuts in the remaining fat for a few minutes until they begin to change colour. Drain the rice and add to the pan along with the salt, saffron and orange flower water. Cook, stirring constantly, for a few minutes. Pour in the water and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Allow to cool slightly. To serve, fluff up the grains of rice with a fork and sprinkle over the shallots. Remove the whole spices before eating.
