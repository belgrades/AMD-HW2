Dredge the turkey escalope in the plain flour and shake off the excess, then dip into the beaten egg and finally into the breadcrumb mix. Pat gently to secure the breadcrumbs to the escalope, then shake off any excess.  Heat the olive oil and butter in a frying pan, add the turkey escalope and fry for 3-4 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown all over and cooked through. For the fried new potatoes, melt the butter and oil in a frying pan, add the potatoes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown on all sides. For the sweet pepper sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the pepper and garlic and lightly fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the pepper has softened. Stir in the honey, butter and a splash of water, then transfer to a mini food processor and blend until smooth. To serve, pile the fried new potatoes onto a serving plate, top with the breaded turkey escalope and drizzle around the sweet pepper sauce. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve.
