Measure the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl, forking together to mix. With an electric mixer, or by hand, beat the butter and sugar until you have a light and creamy mixture, then add the vanilla paste or extract and the egg, beating again to incorporate. Gently fold in the flour mixture, then, once it’s all mixed in, fold in the chocolate chips. Divide the dough between 6 ramekins (you will need about 4½ tablespoons of batter for each one). Using a small offset spatula or the back of a teaspoon, spread the mixture to cover the bottom of the ramekins, and smooth the tops. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 13–15 minutes. They will still be quite gooey inside, but the top will be set, and they should be golden brown at the edges and just beginning to come away from the sides of the ramekins. Leave to cool for 5–10 minutes before serving. You can spoon a scoop of ice cream on top of each one or serve with cream or crème fraîche on the side. They will set as they cool down, so don’t dally now.
