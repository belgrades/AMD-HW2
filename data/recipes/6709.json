To make the blue cheese scones, place the flour, baking powder and butter into a food processor and blend. Add the cheese, egg and milk and blend again, until the mixture is just coming together. Bring the dough together with floured hands and roll onto a floured surface to 1cm\/½in thickness. Using a 5cm\/2in chefs' ring, cut five rounds out of the pastry, then brush them with milk. Place the rounds onto a baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until risen and golden. To make the pea soup, heat the olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and shallot and fry for two minutes to soften. Add the peas and cook for five minutes. Add the stock and blue cheese, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for 10 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then blend with a hand blender until smooth. To serve, pour into a large cappuccino cup or small bowl and place onto a large plate with the scones piled alongside.
