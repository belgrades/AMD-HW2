Place a slice of chicken diagonally across the spring roll pastry.  Lay 6 prawns on top of the chicken slice. Top with two to three chilli strips and a handful of coriander.  Place another slice of chicken over the coriander. Fold in ends of pastry and roll up in an envelope shape. Secure with a cocktail stick. Deep-fry the chicken and prawn rolls in hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes.  Do not have oil too hot or the rolls will brown before the filling is cooked through. Drain on absorbent kitchen towels. Remove cocktail stick from each roll.
