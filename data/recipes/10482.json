Cook for three to four minutes until the sugar has melted. Add the sultanas and cook until just reduced. Add all the other ingredients, bring to the boil and cook for about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Leave the chutney with a chunky texture and not too cooked as that will cause it to be a pur√©e.  Cool the chutney, place into sterilised jars and store for two to three weeks in the fridge.
