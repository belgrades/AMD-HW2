On a clean surface lay two sheets of filo pastry out alongside each other on a clean, flat surface. Brush with the egg and lay another sheet over each. Spoon a little of the fruit mixture into the middle of each sheet at one end. Roll up as you would a spring roll, whilst brushing with the egg so it sticks. Heat the oil in a deep saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles in it (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous do not leave unattended) and add the parcels and deep-fry until golden, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.  To serve, place the fruit roll onto a plate and drizzle with honey.
