Brush them with a little of the oil while cooking (using a silicone brush). Cook for four minutes and then turn over and cook for a further three minutes. Deglaze the pan with the vinegar and a knob of butter. Cook until the volume of liquid has reduced to thick glaze. Brush the sauce onto the chop.

To serve, lay each chop in the middle of a plate, pour on the broad beans and top with the broad bean flowers.
