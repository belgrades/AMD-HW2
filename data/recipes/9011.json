Cover with a lid and leave to cook gently for 10 minutes until the onion has softened. Add the garlic and curry powder and stir fry for 1 minute. Add the rice and stir to mix, then add the stock. Stir well and cover with a lid. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, then turn the heat down and simmer gently with the lid on for about 15 minutes, checking that it doesn’t dry out. When the rice has absorbed all the stock it should be tender. If not, add a splash of boiling water then cook for a further 5 minutes and check again. Stir in the flaked mackerel, peas, lemon juice and parsley and mix carefully, as you don’t want the mackerel to break up too much. Season to taste with salt and pepper and cook for 1 more minute to make sure it’s hot through then serve.
