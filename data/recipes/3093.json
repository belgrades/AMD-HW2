Dip the Camembert into the egg and then place into the herbed crumb.  Heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed pan. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) When the oil is hot deep-fry the breaded Camembert for 2-3 minutes or until crisp and golden. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper. For the sauce, sauté the pepper, chilli flakes, garlic and breadcrumbs for 2-4 minutes or until softened. Blend in a food processor until smooth. You may need some water to loosen it. Serve the deep fried cheese with the red pepper sauce.
