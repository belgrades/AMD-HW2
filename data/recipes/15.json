{"recipe_name":"Acacia honey-glazed chicken breast with tomato, artichoke and watercress","author":"Jean-Christophe Novelli","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the Artichoke, cut off the stalk, pull off the hard outer leaves and trim off the top of the leaves with scissors. Shorten the artichoke heart neatly and evenly, cutting off the top two-thirds of its height.  Wash the artichoke, and tie with string around the largest part of the circumference. Place a slice of lemon under the string, on the base.   Mix the flour with a little water to create a smooth paste. Add to a saucepan of boiling salted water.  Place the artichoke base-downwards into the pan of boiling salted water and boil until softened. The bottom of the artichoke will give way slightly when properly cooked through. Remove and place in iced water to cool. Keep the cooking liquid and set to one side. Remove all the outer leaves, until you reach the centre of the artichoke. Remove the centre of artichoke with a spoon to reveal the heart. Trim base with a knife and place into cooled cooking liquid until required. For the chicken, heat a frying pan until hot, then add the olive oil and chicken breast, skin-side down. Fry for 6-7 minutes then turn the breast over, and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Turn back over onto the skin side, pour over the honey and allow to caramelise in the heat.   When the chicken is completely cooked through (the juices should run clear when tested with a skewer) squeeze over the lemon juice, remove from the heat and place to one side. For the salad, slice the artichoke heart into eight pieces. Place the beef tomato, artichoke, cucumber, shallots, garlic, chives, chervil, sherry vinegar, mustard and yoghurt into a bowl and mix together well. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, place the salad into the centre of a plate. Slice the chicken breasts at an angle of 45 degrees and place a fan of slices on top of the salad. Garnish with watercress and serve.
