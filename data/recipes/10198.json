Rub the marinade over the chicken until it is completely coated, then chill in the fridge for 3-4 hours. Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Place the chicken onto the rack above a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes (or on a charcoal grill for about 12 15 minute until cooked).  Preheat the grill to high. Remove the chicken from the oven and rest for 2-3 minutes. Baste thoroughly with butter and roast under the grill for 3-4 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a skewer and it is completely cooked through. For the salad, mix the ingredients together and set aside. Whisk the dressing ingredients in a bowl together until well combined and pour it over the salad. For the mint chutney, put all the ingredients except the yoghurt into a food processor and blend until well combined.
