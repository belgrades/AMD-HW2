Spoon equal quantities of the cake batter into two greased microwave-safe ramekins (to half-fill) and cover with cling film before microwaving at full power for 3½ minutes, or until risen and cooked through. For the syrup, place the sugar and wine into a small pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Add the cardamom, vanilla pod and apricots and reduce the heat to simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and is slightly syrupy. To serve, turn the sponges out onto serving plates.
