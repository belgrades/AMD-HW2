Strip the cooked meat from the turkey, keeping the pieces as large as you can. They will stay juicier that way.  Peel the garlic and add to a pestle and mortar along with a generous pinch of salt. Grind to a paste and transfer to a bowl. Stir in the honey, soy sauce, chilli sauce, ketchup, mustard and a drizzle of groundnut oil. Season with a little black pepper, then add the turkey meat.
