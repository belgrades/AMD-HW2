Gradually add the oil until you have a thick paste, and set aside. For the layered loaf, heat a griddle pan to hot. Toss the courgettes in a little olive oil and place them on the hot griddle and cook for 2-3 minutes. Slice off the top of the loaf of bread. Hollow out the loaf by scooping out the soft bread, leaving a 3cm\/1¼in thick wall of bread around the edges. Fill the hollow loaf with layers of the chicken, red onion, courgettes, cheese, tomatoes, basil and pesto, seasoning between each layer. Place the lid of the loaf back on and push down, you can wrap it in cling film and leave overnight or slice straight away. For the salad, place the rocket, Little Gem, cheese and olives in a bowl and mix. Whisk the oil and vinegar together in a small bowl to make a dressing. Just before serving, pour the dressing over the salad and mix. To serve, slice the filled loaf and place on a plate with the salad.
