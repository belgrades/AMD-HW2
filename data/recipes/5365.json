{"recipe_name":"Lunchbox chorizo frittata","author":"Hala El-Shafie","programme":"Eat Well for Less?","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/180C Fan\/Gas 6.  Heat an ovenproof frying pan on the hob until just hot, then add the rapeseed oil, onion and red pepper and fry for 2 minutes until just softened. Turn the heat up, add the chorizo and cook for 3-4 minutes until the chorizo has released its oil and is crisp around the edges. The mixture will go a lovely red colour. While the chorizo cooks, crack the eggs into a large jug and whisk with the milk, a pinch of salt and plenty of black pepper.  Add the garlic and potatoes to the chorizo mixture in the pan and fry for another 2 minutes, stirring, until just hot through. Add the frozen peas and cook for another minute until the whole mixture is hot through.  Keeping the heat up high, pour in the egg mixture and stir briefly, then after a minute turn the hob down to a medium heat. Scatter the parsley over the top. Fry without stirring, for 1-2 minutes, then carefully lift the edge of the frittata with a spatula to check if it is cooked and golden-brown underneath. If it isn’t, cook for another 1 minute then check again. Put the entire pan in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. When the top is bubbled up and slightly golden use a tea towel to grab the handle and give the pan a gentle shake. If the middle wobbles it needs a little longer. If it’s fairly firm, pull it out and put it aside to cool slightly. Slide the frittata out of the pan onto a plate or chopping board. Cut it into slices to serve with a green salad. You can serve this hot or cold. If serving cold, leave to cool to room temperature before storing it in a sealable container in the fridge.
