{"recipe_name":"Chocolate fondant with salted caramel brittle and caramel sauce","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the caramel sauce, place the sugar, butter and salt in a saucepan and heat until the sugar has melted, then add the cream.  Bring it to the boil and let it simmer for three minutes until thick. Transfer to a bowl and chill in the fridge for two hours. For the salted caramel brittle, place the sugar, butter, salt and four tablespoons of water in a heavy-based frying pan and gently heat without stirring. Increase the heat until the caramel turns a light golden-brown. Remove from the heat. Using a spoon or pallet knife smear a line of caramel in the centre of each serving plate. Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Add the hazelnuts to the pan and tip onto the prepared baking tray. Set aside to cool.  Once cold, break the caramel into pieces and set aside. For the chocolate fondant, preheat a flat baking sheet in the oven set to 220C\/450F\/Gas 7. Grease four dariole moulds. Place the chocolate and butter into a bowl over a pan of simmering water and allow to melt. Meanwhile break the eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar and whisk for two minutes or until pale and fluffy, then mix in the flour. Once the chocolate has melted, pour it over the eggs and sugar and stir in well. Spoon some of the mixture into the moulds drop the salted caramel chocolates in and add another spoonful of the mix. Only fill them three-quarters full. Place the fondants on a baking tray and cook in the oven for six minutes To serve, remove the fondants from their moulds and place in the centre of the plates prepared with lines of caramel. Place a quenelle of ice cream on each side of the puddings and garnish with caramel brittle. Dust with cocoa powder. Drizzle some of the caramel sauce around the plate and dot with raspberries.
