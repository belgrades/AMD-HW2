Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat. To make the scones, place the flour, butter, sugar, quark and ginger syrup into a food processor and blend until the mixture comes together as a dough. Using floured hands, knead the dough lightly on a floured surface and pat out to about 2cm\/¾in thick. Using a 5cm\/2in pastry cutter, cut out four scone rounds. Place the scone rounds onto the preheated baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for eight minutes, or until risen and golden. To make the honey syrup, place a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the honey, vanilla pod and seeds and orange juice. Stir to mix together and heat to simmer for 2-3 minutes, until it reaches a thick, syrupy consistency. To serve, place the scones onto a plate with the syrup drizzled over.
