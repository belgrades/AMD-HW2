Fry for three minutes, then turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until completely cooked through. For the fennel pesto, place the fennel into a food processor and blend to a fine purée. Add the dill, pine nuts, ground almonds and parmesan and pulse to combine. Add the olive oil and blend to a porridge-like consistency. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the tomato salsa, place the tomatoes into a bowl and add the lemon juice, sesame oil, Tabasco sauce and coriander leaves. Stir gently to combine. To serve, place a spoonful of fennel pesto into the centre of each plate. Place a sea bass fillet on top of each and spoon the salsa around. Garnish with a few pea shoots and serve.
