Pound the garlic in a mortar and pestle with a large pinch of salt until coarsely ground. Heat a wok until very hot, add a generous amount of olive oil and heat until almost smoking. Add the garlic to the wok, then immediately add the cabbage and stir-fry, moving the wok contents constantly to prevent the garlic from burning.  Cook, adding extra oil as necessary, over high heat until the cabbage is warmed through and still crunchy. Transfer to a large serving platter and sprinkle generously with freshly ground black pepper.
