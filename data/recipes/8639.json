Place the sea bass on a lined baking tray and stuff the cavity with the ginger, garlic, chilli and Thai basil. Mix the soy sauce, fish sauce and honey and use it to coat the fish. Lay the pak choi around the seabass and cover the tray with aluminium foil. Cook in the oven for 10 minutes with the foil and then remove the foil and cook for a further 10-15 minutes. For the miso glazed aubergines, heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C, or until a 2cm\/1in cube of bread dropped into the oil turns golden-brown and crisp within 1 minute. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the diced aubergine for 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown and crisp. Set aside to drain on kitchen roll. In a saucepan, heat the white miso, sugar, honey and 100ml\/3½fl oz water. Simmer until it has reduced in volume and turned golden-brown. To serve, place the diced aubergine onto a serving platter and spoon over the sauce. Place the fish in the centre and garnish with the sesame seeds, micro cress and spring onions. Arrange the baked bak choi around the plate.
