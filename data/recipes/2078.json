Heat a chargrill pan until smoking, then add the steak and chargrill for 1-2 minutes on both sides (for rare), or for longer if you prefer your steak medium or well done. Remove the steak from the pan to rest on a warm plate.  Return the pan to the heat and deglaze with the wine. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by about a third. Stir in the cream and chilli and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, then stir in half of the coriander.  To serve, place the egg noodles on a serving plate and top with the steak.
