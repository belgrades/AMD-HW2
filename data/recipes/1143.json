If mixing by hand, this will take about eight minutes. Add the butter to the dough and mix for a further five minutes in the mixer, or 10 minutes by hand. Put the dough into a bowl, cover and leave in the fridge overnight. The dough should now be stiff and easily shaped. Cut the dough into 50g\/1¾oz pieces and divide 45g\/1½oz for the brioche bodies and 5g\/¼oz for the brioche heads.  Using your hands, shape the dough pieces into balls. Put each large piece of dough into a brioche mould and push a smaller dough on top of each once. Leave the brioche in a warm place to rise for one hour. Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Brush the brioche with the egg wash and bake for 20 minutes, or until golden-brown.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
