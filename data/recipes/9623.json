(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.) Add the potato chips and deep-fry for 8-10 minutes, until crisp and golden. Carefully remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.  For the steak, place the steak in between two sheets of cling film. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, bash to flatten. Heat the oil in a non stick-frying pan. Add the steak and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, for medium, or longer, according to personal taste. Remove the steak from the pan and allow to rest for a few minutes.  Using the same pan the steak was cooked in, crack the egg in and fry for 2 minutes, until the yolk is set. To serve, pile the chips up onto a serving plate and serve the steak and fried egg alongside.
