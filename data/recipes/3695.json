(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended!) Carefully place the tortilla triangles into the oil and deep-fry until golden, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To make the tapenade, place all of the tapenade ingredients into a food processor and blend to a coarse paste. To serve, place the tapenade in a small bowl in the centre of a plate with the tortilla crisps around. Garnish with the lemon wedge and a flatleaf parsley leaf.
