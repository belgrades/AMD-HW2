Pour the cake mixture into a greased 22.5cm\/9in cake tin and place into the oven to bake for 1-1¼ hours, or until cooked through. Test by pushing a skewer into the centre of the cake.

For the icing, beat the butter and cheese together in a clean bowl until light and fluffy. Add sugar and vanilla extract and mix well. Add the coconut and mix again. Once the cake is cool, remove from the cake tin and spread the icing all over the cake.  Decorate the cake with a few crushed pecans and serve in generous slices.
