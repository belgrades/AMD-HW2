{"recipe_name":"Steamed hake with chickpeas","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Heat one teaspoon of the oil in a deep-sided, heavy-based ovenproof, lidded pan over a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the chorizo and fry for 1-2 minutes, stirring regularly, or until crisp on both sides. Pour in the sherry and continue to cook until the liquid has evaporated, then remove the chorizo from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Add the remaining teaspoon of oil to the same pan, then add the onion and garlic and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.  Add the canned tomatoes and paprika, stir well to combine, then continue to cook for a further 4-5 minutes. Return the cooked chorizo to the pan along with the peas, beans, cooked chickpeas and fish stock. Stir well to combine, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Place the hake steaks on top of the mixture in the pan. Cover the pan with a lid, then transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the hake is cooked through.  When the hake is cooked through, squeeze over the lemon juice and sprinkle over the chopped parsley. To serve, place one hake steak onto each of four serving plates. Spoon the chickpea and vegetable mixture alongside. Serve with crusty bread.
