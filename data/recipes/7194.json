In a frying pan, gently fry the onion, garlic and bacon. Add the Calvados to flambé the pan - take care to avoid the flames. Scrape any cooked-on food from the bottom of the pan. Place the mixture into a bowl and leave to cool. Place the minced pork and sausage meat into a large bowl. Add the sage, parsley, ginger, nutmeg, pistachios and apricots, and season with salt and pepper. Add the onion mixture to the bowl along with two of the eggs and the breadcrumbs. Mix together to create your filling. Dust a surface with flour and lay out the rolled pastry. Place the filling onto the pastry and make a sausage shape off-centre. Brush the edges of the pastry with the remaining egg. Fold the pastry over to create the sausage roll. Seal around the edges and brush with the egg. Using a sharp knife, slash the top of the sausage roll to create lines in the pastry. Finish with a grind of black pepper. Place in the oven and cook for 10 minutes at 200C\/400F\/Gas 6, then turn the oven down to 170C\/340F\/Gas 3½ and cook for a further 10-15 minutes.
