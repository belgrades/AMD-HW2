{"recipe_name":"Lamb stew with chapattis","author":"Paul Rankin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the stew, heat the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion, garlic and ginger for 4-5 minutes, to soften. Add the lamb to the pan and stir-fry until browned all over. Add the spices, then the tomato, stir well and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the tomato starts to break down, stirring occasionally. Stir the spinach into the lamb mixture. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and remove from the heat. For the chapattis, mix together the flour, salt and enough warm water to form a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.  Divide the dough into 3 or 4 pieces, roughly the size of a small apple, and roll out into thin circles using a rolling pin. Scatter over the black onion seeds and press them down into the dough. One by one, dry-fry the rolled-out dough circles in a frying pan on both sides until they start to bubble up and turn golden-brown.  To serve, heat up the stew and serve with the two or more chapattis (keep any leftover chapattis for another meal).
