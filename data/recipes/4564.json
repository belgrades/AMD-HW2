Place the flour, baking powder and cheese into a food processor and pulse to combine. In a separate bowl, mix together the milk, yoghurt and oil.

Roll out to about 2.5cm\/1in thick. Heat an ovenproof griddle pan until hot and melt the butter in the pan. Cut out discs of the dough with a pastry cutter and fry on one side until golden-brown. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook until risen and golden-brown on top, about 7-8 minutes. Serve the scones on a board, scattered with parsley.
