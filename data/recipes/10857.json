{"recipe_name":"Venison tartare, hazelnut mayonnaise and apple","author":"Tom Kitchin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"no cooking required","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the mayonnaise, put the egg yolk, mustard and vinegar in a bowl. Whisk until emulsified. Place the bowl on a kitchen cloth (to stop it from moving around) and slowly whisk in the vegetable and hazelnut oil. Season with freshly squeezed lemon juice, to taste, then cover and store in the fridge until needed. For the venison tartare, use a sharp knife to remove any sinew from the fillet, then cut the meat into a very fine dice. Put the meat in a medium bowl and place in a large bowl or roasting tray filled with ice. Season the meat well with salt and pepper before mixing in the apple, carrot, celeriac, chives and hazelnuts.  Add a tablespoon of the mayonnaise. Stir in the vinegar and mix until combined, adding more mayonnaise if needed. I like to mould the tartare in a lightly greased metal ring from a stylish presentation, but it can be just spooned into the centre of serving plates. Serve the tartare with a quail’s egg yolk on top of each portion and a little extra cracked pepper. Garnish with the croûtons.
