Leave to infuse until the cream is completely cool. Scrape out the tiny seeds from the pod and leave in the cream.  Over a low heat dissolve the sugar in the water, then turn up the heat and boil rapidly to get a light syrup (it's ready when a little dropped on to a cold plate forms a thread when stretched between finger and thumb. Leave the mixture to cool for just 1 minute. Place the egg yolks in a basin and begin whisking (ideally with an electric whisk), trickling in the hot syrup as you go. Continue whisking until the mixture is thick and mousse-like. Whisk in the cream. Then pour into an ice cream machine and churn until frozen.
