Heat gently until the fruit is soft and stewed.  Taste and adjust the seasoning - adding sugar if it's too savoury, vinegar if it's too sweet.  Set aside. For the pickle, heat the butter in a heavy pan.  Add the fruit, vegetables, vinegar, sugar and molasses and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.   Tip in the fruit compote and simmer gently for 20 minutes.   Leave to cool then decant into sterilised preserving jars. The flavour will improve over time.  For non-vegetarians it is a good accompaniment to slices of roast beef and chicken liver parfait.
