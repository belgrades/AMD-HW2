{"recipe_name":"Clotted cream rice pudding with raspberries and orange caramel","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the rice pudding, heat a saucepan until hot. Add the butter and rice and cook for one minute, stirring to coat the rice with the melted butter. Add the sugar, milk, double cream, vanilla pod and seeds. Stir well and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and simmer gently for 30-40 minutes until the rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Remove the vanilla pod and discard (or rinse and dry thoroughly to use in another recipe of your choice).  Meanwhile, for the raspberries, heat a frying pan until hot and add the sugar and raspberries. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the raspberries are soft and the sugar has melted. Set aside to cool slightly. For the orange caramel, heat a frying pan until hot. Add the sugar and heat until the sugar melts and starts to caramelise. Add the orange juice (take care as the caramel may spit) and whisk to combine. When ready to serve, stir the clotted cream into the rice pudding and heat through. Spoon the raspberries into the bottom of a serving dish, top with the clotted cream rice pudding and pour the orange caramel over the top. Serve immediately.
