Add the yellow pepper, smoked chillies, black-eye beans and ketchup and simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened. Heat half of the vegetable oil in a frying pan and place a tortilla into the pan. Spread the filling mixture over the tortilla, sprinkle over the grated cheese and fry for 2-3 minutes. Place the remaining tortilla on top. Lightly grease another frying pan of the same size with the remaining oil. Place the second frying pan upside down over the top of the quesadilla and carefully turn it into the second pan. Fry the quesadilla on the other side for 2-3 minutes, until golden-brown. For the soured cream dip, place all the soured cream dip ingredients into a bowl and mix well until combined. To serve, cut the quesadilla into wedges and place onto serving plates with a dollop of the soured cream dip.
