For the ragu, heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 4-5 minutes, until soft.  Add the smoked paprika and Quorn pieces and stir well. Continue to fry for 5-7 minutes, then add the wine and bring to the boil. Add the cream and tomato halves and simmer for 3-4 minutes. For the dumplings, place the flour, baking powder, oil and enough milk to bind the mix into a food processor and pulse until just coming together as a dough.  Add the cheese and pulse again to just combine. Roll pieces of the mix into balls about the size of a tangerine, then place them onto a baking sheet. Press the dough balls down slightly, then transfer to the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown. To serve, place the ragu into a serving bowl with the dumplings alongside.
