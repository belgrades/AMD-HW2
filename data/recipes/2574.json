{"recipe_name":"Confit chicken wing with blue cheese mousse and pickled pumpkin","author":"Michael Wignall","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the mousse, put the cheese and cream in a heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat, stir and bring to the boil. Stir in the butter until blended. Strain into a small container, cover and chill for 3 hours. Meanwhile, put the chicken winglets in a small roasting tray and lightly sprinkle with salt. Cover with cling film and chill for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 90C\/Gas 1\/4. Wash the salt off the winglets and dry them with kitchen paper. Return them to the tray and cover completely with the melted duck fat. Bake for 1½ hours, or until the chicken is soft and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the fat, reserving the fat. While warm, pull the meat off the bones, place on a baking tray and cover with another weighted tray. Leave until set. Meanwhile, for the pickled pumpkin, put all ingredients apart from the pumpkin into a saucepan. Add 200ml\/½ pint water, then bring to the boil and cook for 2 minutes. Strain into a separate saucepan, add the pumpkin and simmer for 4 minutes. Leave to cool. For the pumpkin purée, melt the butter in a large heavy-based saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the pumpkin and fry for 5 minutes, but do not colour. Pour in the stock and simmer until soft. Tip into a blender and blend until smooth. Season with salt to taste. For the seaweed seasoning, put all the ingredients in a food processor and blend to a smooth powder. You can store it in an airtight container. For the pumpkin crunch, mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl.  To serve, put the pumpkin purée in the centre of a shallow serving bowl. Spoon the pumpkin pickle and crunch around the outside. In a non-stick pan, fry the winglet meat in a little of the duck fat until crisped, then arrange on top of the purée. Using a hot teaspoon, spoon the mousse into the winglet, then lightly sprinkle with the seaweed seasoning and serve.
