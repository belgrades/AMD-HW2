(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Lay out one sheet of ready-made filo pastry and brush with the beaten egg. Top this sheet with another sheet of ready-made filo pastry and repeat, until there are three layers of filo. Repeat this process to create two prepared filo bases. Place two apricots into the centre of each filo base and drizzle with honey. Brush the edges of the pastry with a little of the beaten egg and fold over all sides. Press to seal the pastry so that the apricots are encased in little parcels. Carefully place the apricot parcels into the hot oil and deep-fry for three minutes, or until golden. Remove and drain on kitchen towels. Combine the sugar and mixed spice in a bowl and toss the parcels in the mixture to coat. Serve each parcel with a dollop of Greek yoghurt.
