Heat the mixture until it begins to simmer.  Then remove the pan from the heat and set aside to infuse. Place the egg yolks and the sugar into a large bowl and whisk together until they have combined and formed a smooth texture. Remove the vanilla pod from the cream and milk mixture and set aside (the pod can be used again, for another dish).  Gradually add the warm milk and cream mixture into the egg bowl, whilst whisking vigorously.  Once the mixtures have combined, pour the liquid back into the saucepan and return to the heat.  Stir the mixture continually until the mixture becomes thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Remove the pan from the heat, cover with cling film and transfer to the fridge to cool for five minutes. For the topping, place all the ingredients into a clean bowl and mix well, until the ingredients have combined. For the cranberries, place the cranberries along with a tsp water into a small saucepan over a low heat and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the cranberries have burst. Stir in the sugar, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool slightly.  To serve, place the sponge fingers into a tall, clean dessert glass and pour the orange juice over the sponge fingers.  Pour the cranberry mixture, followed by the custard over the sponge fingers. Spoon the cream mixture on top of the custard.  Dust the cream with icing sugar.
