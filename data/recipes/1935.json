Add the chicken pieces and stir well to coat evenly.  Cover and place in the fridge, ideally for 24 hours, but at least overnight.  Preheat the oven to 180C\/360F\/Gas 4.  For the onions, heat a frying pan until hot, then add the vegetable oil.  Add the cumin seeds, garlic and ginger and stir fry for 30 seconds.  Add the onions and almonds and fry for a further 2-3 minutes.  Place the marinated chicken into a large casserole.  Add the onion mixture and water and stir well to combine.  Cover and place in the oven for 1-1¼ hours until the chicken is tender.  Just before serving, stir in the garam masala and chopped coriander.  For the flatbread, crumble the yeast into a small bowl, then whisk in 2-3 tablespoons of lukewarm water.  Sift the flour, salt and sugar into another bowl.  Pour the yeast water onto the flour and add 10 tablespoons of water. Mix to form a dough. Add another tablespoon or more of water if necessary to achieve a pliable dough. Knead the dough until it is soft and pliable.  Place in a bowl, cover loosely and leave to prove in a warm place for two hours.  Remove the dough from the bowl and knead lightly to knock out the excess air.  Divide into golf-ball-sized balls, then allow to prove for a further 15 minutes.  Roll out to a thin, 14cm\/7in disc.  Heat the vegetable oil in a griddle pan until hot, then add the disc and grill for three minutes on each side.  Serve with the chicken korma.
