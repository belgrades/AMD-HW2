Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat. Add the spring onion and ginger and fry for 3-4 minutes, until the onion is softened, but not coloured. Add the crabmeat, sherry, sweetcorn purée and the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes. Add the remaining sweetcorn and the cornflour paste and stir well. Pass the beaten egg through a fine sieve held over the soup to create strings of egg in the soup. Cook until the eggs have set as strands. To serve, ladle equal quantities of the soup into bowls and garnish with sesame seeds and chillies.
