Do not leave unattended). To cook the eggs, bring a pan of water to the boil and add a pinch of salt.  Boil the eggs for 6 minutes.  When cooked, remove and refresh in ice-cold water.  When cool, shell the eggs and set aside.  For the Scotch egg mix, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and keep in the fridge. For the bhaji mix, mix all the ingredients in a bowl and stir in just enough cold water to produce a thick, smooth batter.  To make the bhajis, take a ball of Scotch egg mix roughly the size of an egg.  Flatten it out, and then wrap it around one of the soft-boiled eggs. Repeat with the remaining eggs.  Roll each Scotch egg in flour and dust off the excess.  Roll in the bhaji mix, then lift out and carefully lower into the hot oil.  Fry them two at a time for 8 minutes. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.  Meanwhile, for the dressing. Mix all the imgredients together in a bowl.  To serve, place the bhajis on a serving plate and cut in half. Drizzle over the yoghurt dressing.
