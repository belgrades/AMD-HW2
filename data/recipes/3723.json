Brush one side of each sheet of filo pastry with a little vegetable oil and press the oiled sides together; cut into two squares. In a small bowl, mix together the apple, sultanas and spices. Arrange a little of the apple mixture on one half of each filo square, so that the pastry can be folded over diagonally. Fold each over to make a triangular parcel, seal the edges and brush with more oil. Put the triangles on a baking tray and cook for six minutes, until golden and cooked through.
