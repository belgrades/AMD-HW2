Heat the butter in a medium-hot pan and seal the steak on all sides. Add the garlic and flambé with the Cognac. Remove the steak and place to one side for further cooking.  Deglaze the pan with the red wine and add the beef stock, reducing slightly. Add the cream and reduce a little more.  Return the steak to the pan, along with any of the juices, and cook until done to your liking.   Place the ham under a hot grill, to warm. Meanwhile, quickly fry the egg, keeping the yolk runny.   On a serving plate, place the steak in the centre and the fried egg on top.  Place the crispy ham on the egg and pour the reduced sauce liberally over. Serve immediately.
