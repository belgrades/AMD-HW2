Cover with water and bring to a simmer, then cook for 20–25 minutes until tender. Drain the lentils. Season and add a good dash of extra virgin olive oil, then cover and keep warm. Meanwhile, blanch the Swiss chard leaves in salted boiling water for about 3 minutes until tender. Drain well, squeezing out excess water.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a clean pan and fry the sliced garlic with the fennel seeds over a medium-high heat for 30 seconds. Add the drained Swiss chard and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, remove from the heat, cover and keep warm. Heat a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat. Toss the scallops in a bowl with salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. When the pan is very hot, carefully place the scallops in the pan and cook for 1 minute on each side until golden-brown and cooked through. Add the capers, chilli, sage leaves and a squeeze of lemon. Serve hot, with the lentils and Swiss chard.
