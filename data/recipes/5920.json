{"recipe_name":"Mushroom biryani with omelette topping","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the omelettes, mix the eggs, cream and coriander together in a bowl and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a little of the oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add a quarter of the omelette mixture and fry gently, until it begins to set. Fold over the omelette and cook until just set, then transfer to a plate. Keep warm. Repeat the process to make three more omelettes. Set aside. For the marinated mushrooms, mix all of the marinated mushrooms ingredients, except the mushrooms and the vegetable oil, in a bowl. Set the marinade mixture aside. Heat the oil in a pan and fry the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes, until golden-brown. Add the cooked mushrooms to the marinade and set aside.  For the chilli paste, place all of the chilli paste ingredients into a food processor and blend to a rough paste.  For the biryani, heat the oil in a separate frying pan. Add the onion and fry until softened. Add the chilli paste and cook for five minutes. Add the rice and bay leaves and fry for 3-4 minutes. Add enough stock to cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is cooked through. Spread the cooked rice onto a clean tray to cool, drizzle with rose water and lemon juice and sprinkle with the chopped mint. Preheat the oven to 180C\/360F\/Gas 4. Grease four 10cm\/4in chefs' rings and place onto a baking tray. Pack a layer of the rice mixture into each ring, then top with a layer of the marinated mushrooms. Repeat these layers until each ring is full - making sure the top layer is rice. Cover each ring with aluminium foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes.  To serve, place an omelette on top of each biryani stack.
