Place eggs, milk, salt and pepper into a large bowl. Whisk to combine. With a sharp, thin-bladed knife, carefully slit open one side of each slice of bread to form a pocket. Ensure that you leave 1cm\/0.5in around the edges. Spread the mustard on one side of the pocket and place a slice of ham and cheese inside. Put the pockets into a shallow dish. Pour over the egg mixture and leave for five minutes, turning once. Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat, add half of the olive oil and swirl to coat the base of the pan.
