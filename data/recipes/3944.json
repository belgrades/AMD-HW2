Use a sharp knife to cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast. Slice the soft goat's cheese and press into the pocket in the chicken breasts.

When the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts, presentation-side down and fry until golden-brown. Turn the breasts and cook for a further two minutes on the other side, then transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 15 minutes.
