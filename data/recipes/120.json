Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Mix the apples with the cinnamon, lemon zest and juice, sugar and raisins. In a small frying pan, melt 20g\/¾oz butter and fry the breadcrumbs until golden-brown, then add to the apple mixture. Melt the remaining butter in a pan. On a clean, dry tea-towel lay a sheet of the filo and brush with some of the melted butter. Lay another sheet on top and repeat until you have used all of the filo.  Pile the filling along the length of the pastry along one side about 2-3cm\/1in from the edge and using the tea-towel to help you, roll the pastry up to enclose the filling. Tuck the ends in and roll seam-side down onto the lined baking sheet. Brush with the remaining melted butter.  Bake for 40-45 minutes, until golden-brown.  Leave to cool to room temperature and dust with icing sugar. Slice and serve with cream, ice cream or custard.
