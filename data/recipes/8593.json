Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Using your fingertips, lightly rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the sugar and the milk and lightly mix until just combined.  Tip the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using the palm of your hand, flatten out the dough out until it is about 2cm\/1in thick. Cut out 8-12 scones using a 5cm\/2in fluted cutter.  Place the scones on to the lined baking tray and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones are golden-brown and well-risen. Remove from the oven and place onto a wire rack until cool enough to handle.  Serve the scones with clotted cream and raspberry jam.
