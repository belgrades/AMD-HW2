Add the spring onions and ginger and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until softened. Add the red chilli and garlic and stir-fry for a further 1-2 minutes, or until softened.  Add the tomato ketchup, tomatoes and fish sauce and stir well to combine. Add the stock (or water) and bring the mixture to the boil. Continue to boil until the cherry tomatoes 'burst' in the wok, about 4-5 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Meanwhile, sprinkle the flour onto a plate and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Dredge the fish pieces in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess.  Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the coated fish pieces, in batches if necessary, and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden-brown and cooked through.  Just before serving, add the fried fish pieces to the sweet-and-sour sauce and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until warmed through.  To serve, spoon the sticky rice into the centre of each of four serving plates. Spoon over the sweet-and-sour red snapper.
