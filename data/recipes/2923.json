{"recipe_name":"Crème brûlée with sugared almonds and a rhubarb purée","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Using an egg cutter, cut the top off the large eggs and pour out the contents. Dry the egg shells out. Put the egg yolks in a bowl, add the caster sugar and vanilla seeds. Whisk together until pale, fluffy and well combined. In a small pan, bring the milk and cream to a gentle boil. Gradually pour over the egg mixture.  Pour the mix back in the pan and cook until it has thickened, and coats the back of a spoon. Leave aside to cool. Carefully ladle the mixture into the dried egg shells. Just before serving sprinkle the demerara sugar on top and carmelise it using a chef's blowtorch.  For the almonds, preheat the oven to 130C\/110C Fan\/Gas 1 and line a baking tray. Lightly beat the egg white with 1 tablespoon water. Add the almonds and stir until well-coated. Mix the sugar and salt together and sprinkle over the nuts. Toss to coat, and spread evenly on the tray. Cook for 1 hour in the oven, stirring occasionally, until golden-brown. Leave to cool.  Increase the oven temperature to 200C\/180C Fan\/Gas 6. Put the rhubarb in a roasting tin. Sprinkle over the sugar, then drizzle over the juice. Roast the rhubarb in the oven for 8-12 minutes, or until just tender. Leave to cool. Place in a blender and blend until smooth. Serve the crème brûlée egg on a serving plate alongside the rhubarb purée and sugared almonds.
