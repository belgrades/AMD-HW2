For the pastry, use a pizza cutter to cut the pastry into 24 x 5cm\/2in squares. Brush one side of all the squares lightly with melted butter. Place one square on top of another at an angle, buttered-side-up, to make a star shape, then push into a hole of a mini muffin tray buttered-side down. Repeat until all the squares are used up. Bake for 6–8 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from tin and leave to cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, for the prawn filling, heat the sesame oil in a large frying pan or wok.

Add the mangetout, pak choi and beansprouts and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes, or until all the vegetables are just tender. Stir in the soy sauce, then remove from the heat.
