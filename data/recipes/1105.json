Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended!) Deep fry the mushrooms until golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels. To make the dip, place all the ingredients into a food processor, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix until smooth. Serve the mushrooms on a plate with the dip in a small bowl.
