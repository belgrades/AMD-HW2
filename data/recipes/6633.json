Place the peaches on a baking tray and use a blow torch to blister the skins (alternatively place under a hot grill, turning occasionally). Set aside until cool enough to handle, then remove the skins. Cut in half and remove the stone. Place the peaches in a baking tray, cut-side up, and dot butter on top. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until soft but still holding their shape. Heat a frying pan until hot, add the caster sugar and melt until it forms a caramel, swirling the pan occasionally. Add the orange juice and swirl to combine. (CAUTION: boiling sugar is extremely hot. Handle very carefully.) Add the flaked almonds, pistachio nuts and raspberries and heat through for two minutes only – you don’t want the raspberries to break down. To serve, place the cooked peaches into a shallow serving bowls and pour over the sauce. Serve with vanilla ice cream and sprinkle over the nuts.
