Place another piece of cling film on top and, using a rolling pin, hit the tuna until it is very thin. Remove the top piece of cling film. Place a 20cm\/8in diameter plate over the tuna and cut round it. Flip everything upside down so the plate is on the bottom. Heat a frying pan and add the oil, once hot add the sliced bread and cook on each side until crisp. Remove the remaining cling film and lay the toasted sourdough over the tuna. Place a serving plate on top, upside down. Flip the plates over, so the tuna is on top of the bread, on the serving plate. For the tuna tartare, finely dice the rest of the tuna and place in the bowl with the shallot, mustard, lemon juice and half of the chives. To serve, garnish the tuna carpaccio with the tuna tartare and the rest of the chives.
