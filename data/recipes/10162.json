Leave to drain for 20-25 minutes, to remove excess moisture, then rinse in cold water and pat dry. In a small saucepan warm the groundnut oil and chilli oil. Add the garlic and chilli and warm for a minute. Add the sugar, Sichuan peppercorns, ginger and rice wine vinegar, bring to the boil and simmer for five minutes. Add the cucumber and spring onions, increase the heat to high and boil for 10-15 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to go completely cold. When the liquid is cold, add the bamboo shoots, mangetout and bean sprouts.  For the steak, season the steaks with salt. Brush the steaks with vegetable oil and then dip into the peppercorns to coat. Fry the steaks in a very hot frying pan for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove the steak from the pan and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Allow to rest for five minutes, then cut into slices. To serve, place spoonfuls of the salad onto plates and top with slices of beef. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
