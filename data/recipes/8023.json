Fry for 2-3 minutes until the onion has softened.  Add the cinnamon to the pan and continue frying for a further two minutes.  Tip in the kumquats and cook for 3-4 minutes, until just beginning to soften.  Add the brown sugar and pour over the vinegar.  Cover, and simmer for 8-10 minutes, until the kumquats have completely softened and lost their shape.  Remove the lid and continue boiling for a further 6-8 minutes until the juices have cooked down and the marmalade has thickened.  Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool. Preheat the oven to 220C\/425F\/Gas 7. Season the cod with salt and black pepper. Heat a frying pan until hot then add the olive oil and cod, skin-side down. Cook for two minutes then place in the oven for 5-8 minutes until cooked through. Meanwhile, to make the green pepper dressing, place the peppers and water into a food processor and blend to a purée. Strain the mixture through a tea towel into a clean pan. Place the pan on the heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes until the mixture has thickened. Place the micro cress and fennel tops into a bowl and toss with the olive oil, salt and black pepper, to taste. To serve, spoon the kumquat marmalade into the centre of four plates. Place the cod on top and sprinkle the micro cress around the plate. Finish with a drizzle of green pepper dressing.
