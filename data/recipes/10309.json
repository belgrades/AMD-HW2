Combine all of the ingredients apart from the chicken in a food processor and blend until smooth. Brush the chicken generously with the spice mix. Cover the chicken with foil and roast in the oven for 70-80 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a skewer – the cooking time will depend on the size of the chicken.
