Leave the kippers in the water for five minutes, then remove and set aside, reserving the soaking liquid. Carefully remove the meat from the fish, taking care to remove all the bones. Place the kipper meat into a bowl and set aside. Meanwhile, heat a deep frying pan with a lid until hot then add the butter. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and fry for 3-4 minutes, until just softened but not coloured. Add the curry powder and cook for a further minute. Add the rice and stir to coat well in the butter and onions. Add the reserved kipper soaking liquid and heat to a gentle simmer, then cover with the lid and cook for 12-15 minutes, until the rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed. Stir in the double cream and lemon juice. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the kipper meat, eggs and parsley. Stir gently to combine without breaking up the kipper meat too much. To serve, spoon into warmed bowls.
