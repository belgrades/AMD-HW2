{"recipe_name":"Beef curry with crispy noodles","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Gently dry-fry the spices in a large frying pan over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant and toasted. Transfer to a pestle and mortar and grind together. In same pan, heat the oil and add the steak pieces. Fry for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden-brown all over, then remove from the pan. Add the onion to the pan. Reduce the heat and gently fry for 10-12 minutes, until soft and golden-brown. Add the garlic and chillies and fry for two minutes. Add the ground spice mixture, tomatoes, ginger and turmeric and bring to the boil. Add the stock and bring back to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 25 minutes, until thickened. Return the meat to the sauce and allow to warm through. Meanwhile, for the noodles, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Add the noodles to the oil in small batches and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until they puff up and become crisp. Carefully remove the cooked noodles from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To serve, place a large spoonful of basmati rice onto each plate and spoon the curry over or alongside. Place a small handful of the crispy noodles onto the curry and serve with lime wedges on the side.
