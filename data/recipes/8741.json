{"recipe_name":"Seared steak on a potato cake with red wine sauce, pea purée and turmeric potatoes","author":"Alex Mackay","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the red wine sauce, place the red wine into a pan over a medium heat. Crumble in the beef stock cube and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer, until the liquid volume has reduced by two-thirds. Meanwhile, for the sautéed potatoes, place the potato slices into a pan of boiling salted water. Add the turmeric and cook for 6-8 minutes, until the potato is just tender, then drain.  Meanwhile, heat a heavy-based frying pan. Add the butter and once melted, add the potatoes. Fry the potatoes for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden-brown all over. For the steak, heat a griddle pan until smoking hot. Season the steak with freshly ground black pepper and brush with a little oil. Griddle the steak for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Remove the steak from the pan and set aside in a warm place to rest. For the pea purée, place the peas in a mini food processor with the olive oil. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend to a purée. To finish the red wine sauce, mix the cornflour with a little water, then stir the mixture into the simmering sauce. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, until thickened and glossy. To serve, arrange the potato slices in a petal shape onto a warmed plate and place the steak on top. Add the pea purée onto the steak, then drizzle around the red wine sauce.
