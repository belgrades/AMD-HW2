{"recipe_name":"Shrimp ravioli with shrimp and tomato sauce","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pasta, place the flour into a bowl, add the eggs and egg yolks and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well to form a stiff dough. Continue to mix gradually adding the olive oil until a smooth glossy dough is formed. Turn the dough out onto a clean lightly floured surface and knead for five minutes, then cover the dough with cling film and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Pass the dough through a pasta machine, several times, on increasingly fine settings, to create at least two thin sheets of pasta. (Alternatively roll out portions of the pasta dough with a rolling pin to create at least two very thin sheets.) For the filling, place all of the filling ingredients into a food processor and blend to a smooth paste. Place a sheet of the fresh pasta onto a clean, lightly floured work surface and place a spoonful of the filling mixture onto the pasta at 7.5cm\/3in intervals along the sheet. With a pastry brush, brush the pasta around the filling portions with water, then place a second sheet of fresh pasta over the top to cover. Press down around the filling to create a series of sealed pockets in the pasta. Slice into squares of ravioli. Repeat this process with the remaining filling and pasta sheets. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Place the ravioli into the water and simmer for 3-4 minutes, until cooked through and the pasta is tender. Drain and place onto a large serving dish. For the sauce, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the shallots and shrimps and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the shrimps are cooked through. Add the tomatoes and parsley and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, pour the sauce over the ravioli and gently stir to coat. Spoon out onto four plates and serve.
