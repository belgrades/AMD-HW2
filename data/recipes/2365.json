Beat the eggs (if you are using them) with the juice and brandy if you are using it and stir it into the dry mixture.  Sieve the flours together with the baking powder (if you are using it instead of the eggs).  Fold the flour very thoroughly into the fruit. Spoon the mixture into a pudding basin, cover with doubled greaseproof paper and tie with a string or rubber bands.  Put the basin in a deep pan, pour in water to halfway up the bowl, cover the pan tightly and simmer for 4-5 hours, checking the water level periodically. Remove basin from the pot, discard the greaseproof paper and cover it with new. Allow to cool, then store in a cool larder. To serve, re-steam for 1-2 hours or reheat in a microwave for 3-5 minutes.
