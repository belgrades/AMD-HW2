{"recipe_name":"Goats cheese rolled on breadcrumbs and ground almonds (meculin de Crottin de Chavignol)","author":"John Burton Race","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"To make the goats cheese, peel the outside rind from the goats' cheese. Mix the ground almonds and breadcrumbs together. Mix the egg and milk together to make an  egg-wash . Roll the goats cheese into the flour, then the  egg-wash  and then into the almond and breadcrumb mix repeat this twice and then refrigerate. Two coats will stop the cheese from bursting through when fried. To make the pear chutney, peel the pears and leave them whole. Put the port in a small pan and reduce until it becomes syrupy. Add red wine, spices, herbs and garlic and reduce by half. Add the stock syrup (black pepper corns, clove, water and sugar having already been mixed) and bring to the boil. Put the pears in the mixture and cook until they are soft. Insert a knife into the pears and if there is no resistance they are cooked (approx 5 minutes). Allow the pears to cool down in the syrup. It's best made 1 day in advance to maximise flavour. For the walnut dressing, mix all the ingredients together. Season to taste with the salt and pepper. Place the goats cheese into a hot fryer [approximately 170 degrees] until golden brown then, into a preheated hot oven for approx 3 minutes. This will seal the cheese and stop it from bursting out. Dice the pears into cubes and place them neatly onto the plate. Top with the goat's cheese and salad leaves mixed with the chopped shallots, chives and walnut dressing.
