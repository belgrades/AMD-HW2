Melt the small knob of butter in a crÃªpe pan over a medium to high heat and spoon a quarter of the batter mixture onto the hot pan, swirling around to cover the pan base. Cook for 30 seconds on each side, or until golden and cooked. Transfer to a plate and fold in half and then in half again. For the sauce, heat the ingredients in a small frying pan until the liquid has reduced and thickened. Pour over the pancakes to serve.
