Heat a pan and, once hot, add the butter. Add the garlic and shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, then add the tarragon. Place the turkey slices between two pieces of cling film, then use a rolling pin or meat hammer to press to about 5mm\/¼in thick. Discard the cling film. Place the ham and cooked mushrooms on one half of each turkey slice. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fold the other half of the turkey slice over the top and press down lightly.  Put the flour, egg and breadcrumbs into three shallow bowls. Taking care not to allow the filling to escape, pass the turkey first through the flour, then egg and then coat it in breadcrumbs. Heat the butter and the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the turkey parcels and fry on each side for 2-3 minutes until browned. Transfer to the oven for 5-10 minutes, or until cooked through. For the roasted butternut squash, heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the garlic and shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the squash and star anise and cook for five minutes or until the squash has cooked through. Remove the star anise. Serve the squash with the turkey saltimbocca. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and sprinkle with parsley.
