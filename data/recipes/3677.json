{"recipe_name":"Fried semolina-crusted aubergine with honey","author":"Sabrina Ghayour","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Peel the aubergines and cut them into 3.5cm\/1¼in thick discs. Then cut each slice roughly into pieces about 5cm\/2in in diameter. Shape variation doesn’t matter and neither does size inconsistency – just make the pieces roughly around the same size so that they cook in the same time. Pour about 5cm\/2in vegetable oil into a large, deep frying pan and heat the oil over a high heat. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Pour the milk into a small bowl.  Tip the semolina on to a small side plate and season it well with crushed salt.  Dip the aubergine pieces into the milk, then shake off any excess milk and immediately roll the pieces in the seasoned semolina.   Cooking in batches, put the coated aubergine pieces into the hot oil and fry for approximately 1 minute on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Once cooked, transfer to a tray or plate lined with kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil. Repeat with subsequent batches.   Serve with a good drizzle of clear honey and a sprinkling of chilli flakes, if using.
