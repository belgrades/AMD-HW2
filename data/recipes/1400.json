Dust with the icing sugar and using a mini-blowtorch, caramelise the sugared slices. To make the mousse, place the double cream into a bowl and whip until it is thickened, then fold in the melted Toblerone and crushed amaretti biscuits. To make the almond caramel, place the sugar in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the almonds and cook until the sugar has turned to a brown caramel and is coating the almonds. Pour the caramelised almonds onto greaseproof paper and leave to cool for two minutes and set. Using a rolling pin, shatter the almond caramel into pieces. To serve, place the caramelised orange slices onto a plate. Spoon a portion of chocolate mousse onto each orange slice and garnish with some of the caramelised almond pieces.
