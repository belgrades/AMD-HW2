Place the mince, garlic, coriander and cumin into a bowl and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix together well, then divide the mixture into eight equal portions. Press each portion of the mince mixture around a wooden skewer to form a sausage, three quarters the length of the skewer, then place onto a plate in the fridge to chill. Heat a griddle pan until hot. Place the skewers onto the griddle and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through. Heat a separate frying pan until hot. Add the fig slices and fry on each side for 30 seconds. Remove the figs and set aside, then add the halloumi and cook on each side for one minute, or until golden-brown all over. Whisk the lemon juice, olive oil, salt and freshly ground black pepper together in a clean bowl, then add the salad leaves. Toss well to coat. To serve, place arrange slices of fig and halloumi onto the centre of each plate. Place a pile of the dressed salad leaves on top, then top each dish with two koftas. Drizzle over a little of the remaining dressing and serve.
