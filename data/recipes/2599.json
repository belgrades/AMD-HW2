Brush the oil all over the tuna and roll in the coriander mixture. Heat a griddle pan and place the tuna onto the pan. Cook until bar marks appear and turn the tuna around until you have marks all around the tuna. Make sure it is still pink in the middle.   For the coriander pesto, put the coriander, garlic and coconut into a food processor and blend adding enough oil to give you a coarse paste.  For the salad, place all of the ingredients in a large bowl and mix.  Cut the tuna into odd shapes and dot onto a plate. Place a quenelle of the pesto on the plate and dress with the cabbage salad.
