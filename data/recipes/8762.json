{"recipe_name":"Semolina and orange cake with caramel sauce and crème fraiche","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 8 (makes 1 cake)","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the semolina cake, preheat the oven to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4 and grease a 20cm\/8in loose-bottomed square baking tin with butter. (If you don’t have a square baking tin, a 23cm\/9in round cake tin will also work.) Mix the semolina, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder and orange zest together in a bowl until well combined. Gradually stir in the melted butter and milk until you have a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the greased tin and arrange the almonds on top in four rows. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the cake is golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool in the tin for a few minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. For the caramel sauce, place the sugar, butter and salt in a saucepan and heat until the sugar has melted, then stir in the cream. Bring it to the boil and let it simmer for 3 minutes until thick. Set aside to cool slightly before serving (the sauce can also be served cold). To serve, serve the cake in slices with the caramel sauce and a dollop of crème fraiche. Garnish with a few mint leaves.
