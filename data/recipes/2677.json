Pour in the couscous, and allow to roast and colour slightly in the pan for 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and pour over the hot stock. Cover with cling film set aside for 5-6 minutes, or until the couscous has absorbed all of the liquid.  Fluff up the grains with a fork and stir in the pomegranate seeds and chopped fresh herbs. Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the fish, make three deep incisions in the fish and place a wedge of lemon and a slice of garlic into each. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the salmon, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin is golden-brown and crisp. Transfer the fish to an ovenproof dish, sprinkle with half the herbs and add a splash of stock. Place into the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. To serve, spoon the couscous onto a serving plate and lay the fish fillet on top. Garnish with more fresh herbs.
