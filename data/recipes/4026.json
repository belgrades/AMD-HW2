Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Start by making the pie filling. Break an egg into a bowl then beat with afork. Then add the cream cheese and mix into the egg until well combined.   Add the parmesan and some black pepper. Stir well, then add the grated courgette and give the mixture another good stir. Brush the inside of a small (500g) loaf tin with the oil and line with a sheet of filo pastry with the extra falling over the outside of the tin.  Brush with more oil, then lay another sheet on top creating extra overlap on the side. Brush that layer with oil, then add the third sheet on top.  Pour your eggy filling into the pie then fold the extra pastry over the top, a layer at a time, hiding the filling. Dot the pastry with oil as you build the layers. Finally dab the top of filo pastry with more oil. Ask a grown-up to put it in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the filo topping is golden-brown and crisp.
