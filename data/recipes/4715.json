Leave the banana in the freezer until frozen all the way through (about one hour). Place the frozen banana chunks into a food processor. Add the vanilla, sugar, honey or sweetener and half of the buttermilk (or yoghurt). Turn on the processor and blend for a few moments. Then, while the processor is still running, pour in the remaining buttermilk in a thin, steady stream (if you are using yoghurt, just tip it all in and blend). Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Serve at once.
