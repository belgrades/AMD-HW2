Heat a large non-stick frying pan.  Add a little oil, then brown the lamb in batches.  Remove with a slotted spoon onto a plate. Add the remaining oil to the pan with the garlic and onion and allow to soften for a few minutes.  Lower the heat, then blend in the flour and spices and cook for one minute. Add the wine, chopped tomatoes and tomato purée, and return the meat to the pan. Stir well and bring to the boil.  Season, cover and cook over a low heat for about 1½-2 hours until tender. Alternatively, transfer to the oven at 160C\/320F\/Gas 3 and cook until tender for about the same time. Drain and rinse the black eye beans.  Add the beans to the lamb about 10 minutes before the end of cooking, along with the mango chutney.   Check seasoning. Garnish with sprigs of coriander or mint.  Serve with seasoned Greek-style yoghurt, mixed with the chopped coriander or mint.
