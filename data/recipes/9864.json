For the shortbread, place the butter, flour, icing sugar and egg yolk into a food processor and pulse until the mixture comes together as a dough.

Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until lightly golden-brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. For the filling, place the cream into a large bowl with the icing sugar and vanilla seeds and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gently fold in the strawberries.
