{"recipe_name":"Steamed sponge pudding with custard","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"To make the sponge puddings grease and lightly flour four ramekins. Place the flour, sugar, butter, eggs and milk in a blender and process to a smooth batter. Mix the honey and ground ginger together and place a spoonful in the base of each ramekin. Pour the sponge mixture on top. Lightly place some cling film over the top of each ramekin, so it's not touching the sponge mixture. Place in the microwave on a high setting for two minutes. The sponges should rise, and be just firm to the touch. To make the custard, place the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and whisk until well blended. Place the milk and cream in a saucepan. Scrape the inside of the vanilla pod into the milk mixture and bring to the boil. Sit the bowl of beaten eggs over a pan of hot water and whisk the milk into the egg mixture.  As the egg yolks warm, the mixture will thicken to create custard.  Keep stirring until it coats the back of the spoon.  Remove the bowl from the heat.  To serve, turn out the sponge onto a plate and spoon over the custard.
