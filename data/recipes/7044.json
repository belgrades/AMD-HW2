Place the pomegranate molasses, honey and ground caraway seeds into a small bowl and mix well. Rub the mixture onto the scored skin of the duck breasts. Heat an ovenproof non-stick pan and add the duck breasts, skin-side down and cook for 1-2 minutes to caramelise the skin. Turn the duck breasts over and cook on the other side for 1-2 minutes. Transfer to the oven to cook for 8-11 minutes for medium, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the oven and set the duck breasts aside to rest for five minutes. For the pilaf, place the vegetable stock into a pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Add the bulgar wheat and bring back to the boil. Reduce the heat to simmer for 5-8 minutes, or until the bulgar wheat is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the chickpeas and mix well. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a deep non-stick pan until hot. Add the onions and cook for 3-4 minutes, until softened. Add the cherries and pomegranate molasses, and cook for further 3-5 minutes, until the onions are caramelised and the cherries are beginning to soften down. Add the cherries mixture to the bulgar wheat and chickpea mixture and stir well to combine. Add the chopped parsley and mint, pistachios and pomegranate seeds. To serve, cut each duck breast in half on the diagonal and place onto a plate. Spoon the cooking juices over and a garnish with few pomegranate seeds. Spoon the pilaf into a bowl and serve alongside the duck.
