{"recipe_name":"Pan-fried scallops with a garden salad and grain mustard vinaigrette","author":"Michael Caines","programme":"Countryfile Summer Diaries","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the vinaigrette, place the mustard into a bowl and whisk in the vinegar, water and olive oil. Season with salt and white pepper. Use a hand blender to mix thoroughly until thickened and emulsified. Add the chopped tarragon. For the salad, place the mixed leaves, herbs and shallots into a bowl and gently toss. Dress the salad lightly with the vinaigrette just before cooking the scallops. For the scallops, heat a little olive oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat. Season the scallops with salt and freshly ground black pepper before placing into the pan sliced-side down and cook until golden-brown, about 1-2 minutes. Turn the scallops over and reduce the heat. Cook for a further 1-3  minutes, depending on their size, or until just cooked. Take care not to overcook the scallops. Remove the scallops from the pan and place onto a tray lined with kitchen paper. Squeeze over the lemon juice. To serve, place a little of the dressed salad onto four plates. Place the scallops on and around the salad. Finish by drizzling some of the grain mustard vinaigrette around the plate.
