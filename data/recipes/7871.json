{"recipe_name":"Roast rabbit loin with Moroccan-style couscous and calamari","author":"Shaun Rankin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Lay the loin fillets side by side, top to tail, so they form an even shape together. Carefully wrap the pancetta or Parma ham around both the loin fillets, making sure you overlap the slices so the fillets are covered and are in a single piece. Lay a large sheet of aluminium foil on a work surface, place the covered rabbit on top and roll it up into a sausage shape. Tie the foil in knots at both ends, forcing any air out. Place the couscous grains into a bowl and pour over the hot chicken stock. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place for 15 minutes. Run a fork through the couscous to break up the grains and add one tablespoon of the olive oil, the mixed herbs, black olives, sun blushed tomatoes and toasted pine nuts. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Steam the rolled loin for 4-5 minutes.  Remove the rabbit from the steamer and once cool enough to touch, carefully remove the cling film. Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a frying pan, add the rabbit and cook for 2-3 minutes, turning regularly, until the pancetta is golden-brown. Heat the remaining one tablespoon of olive oil in a separate frying pan, add the calamari strips and fry for 20 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat. Cut the rabbit into 1cm\/½in slices. Melt the butter in a saucepan and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. Keep warm. To serve, spoon the warm couscous onto serving plates and arrange the rabbit on top.  Top with the calamari and drizzle with the lemon butter. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
