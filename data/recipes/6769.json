Drain and place in ice-cold water to refresh. Cut the sprouts in half and remove the outer leaf. Heat a large frying pan. Add the butter and Brussels sprouts and sauté for two minutes, seasoning with salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. Meanwhile, for the steaks, sprinkle the crushed peppercorns over a large plate. Press each steak into the crushed pepper, then season both sides with salt. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the peppered steaks and cook for two minutes on each side, until browned or cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan and set aside to rest.  Add the red wine and the butter. Stir and scrape with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan and melt the butter then remove from the heat. To serve, divide the Brussels sprouts between four serving plates, then place the steaks on top. Spoon the wine sauce over the beef and serve immediately.
