{"recipe_name":"Pan-fried salmon with a medley of roasted vegetables, French fries and champ sauce","author":"Paul Rankin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the salmon, rub the salmon with the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place into a hot frying pan and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. For the vegetables, place the vegetables onto a baking tray, drizzle with the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. For the French fries, heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed pan, until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the potato sticks into the oil and deep-fry for 5-6 minutes, until crisp and golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the sauce, melt the butter in a pan and fry the spring onions until softened.  Add the cream and milk and heat to a gentle simmer. Add the cooked potato and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to a food processor. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then blend until smooth. To serve, pour the sauce onto a warmed plate and place the salmon on top. Place the roasted vegetables around the edge of the plate and serve the French fries in a bowl alongside.
