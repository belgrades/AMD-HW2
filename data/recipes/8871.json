Grate some of the lemon zest over the salmon, and then squeeze the juice, being careful to discard any pips. Fold the foil over the fish then fold the edges of the foil inwards to make a neat parcel. Before the final edge is sealed, spoon in the vegetable stock, and then close the final edge. Lay on a baking tray then bake for 20 minutes.
