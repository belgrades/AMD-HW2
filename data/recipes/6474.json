Rip the bread into bite-sized pieces, place on a baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes. Make sure it doesn't burn - what you're looking for is bread that comes out feeling a little stale. Meanwhile, put the anchovies, two tablespoons of the capers, the oil and vinegar in a pestle and mortar and smash it into a dressing. Grab yourself a big mixing bowl and put in the tomatoes and bread and pour on the dressing, then get stuck in with your hands.
