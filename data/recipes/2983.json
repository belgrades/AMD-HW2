Place the chicken wings, duck fat, garlic, thyme and lemon zest in an ovenproof dish and cover with foil. Place in the oven for an hour.

Add the honey and baste to form a sticky glaze. Season with salt and lemon juice. For the roasted hazelnuts, heat a frying pan and add the hazelnuts and butter. Slowly roast until golden-brown. Once cool, cut in half. For the celeriac purée, place all the ingredients apart from the double cream, into a large saucepan with 250ml\/9fl oz water. Bring to the boil and reduce until the water and butter has emulsified to a third of the volume. Place into a food processor and blend. Season with salt and pepper and pass through a fine sieve. Finish by mixing in the double cream. Keep warm until ready to serve. For the apple and vanilla chutney, place all the ingredients with 50ml\/2fl oz water into a medium saucepan and heat gently until all the liquid has absorbed into the apples. For the cumin roasted scallops, dust the cumin over one side of the scallops. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, fry the scallops cumin-side down until golden-brown then season with salt. Add the butter and turn the scallops over. Pour in the lemon juice and baste the scallops. Finish with a little salt. To serve, place a spoonful of celeriac purée on each plate and using a small palette knife swipe the purée to form a smear.
