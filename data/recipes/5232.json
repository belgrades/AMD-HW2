{"recipe_name":"Lentil croquettes","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the croquettes, cook the Puy lentils according to packet instructions. Drain. Mix the Puy lentils, sweet potato, mixed herbs, breadcrumbs, nutmeg and egg yolk together in a bowl until well combined.   For the coating, sprinkle the flour onto a plate, beat the eggs in a bowl and sprinkle the polenta onto a separate plate. With floured hands, mould small amounts of the mixture into 7.5cm\/3in long cylinders. Dredge the croquettes in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg and finally dip into the polenta to coat completely. Heat the oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Fry the croquettes for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. For the raita, mix the yoghurt, mint and lime zest and juice together in a bowl.  Serve the croquettes with the raita dip alongside.
