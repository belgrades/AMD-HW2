{"recipe_name":"Pork tenderloin with pease pudding and baby carrots","author":"Kenny Atkinson","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pickled baby carrots, place all the ingredients except the carrots into a pan and bring to the simmer. Add the carrots to the pickling liquor and simmer for one minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool. Cover the pan with a lid and set aside to marinate overnight. For the pease pudding, melt the butter in a frying pan and fry the shallots and garlic for 3-4 minutes. Add the bacon and continue to cook for a few more minutes. Add the peas and stock and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the peas are tender and the sauce has thickened. Stir in the parsley and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the pork tenderloin, preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the pork tenderloins on all sides until browned all over. Add the butter and rosemary to the pan and spoon the butter over the pork. Roast the pork in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove the pan from the oven, squeeze a little lemon juice over the pork and baste again with the butter. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside to rest for 10 minutes. For the pea and mint purée, melt the butter in a frying pan and sweat the shallot for 30 seconds. Add the peas and hot milk, season with a pinch of salt and simmer for 5-6 minutes. Drain the peas in a colander and reserve the milk. Put the peas, garlic and mint leaves into a food processor, and with the motor running, gradually add the milk and blend to a purée. (You may not need to add all the milk.) Pass the purée through a fine sieve and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, spoon a little pea purée into the middle of serving plates, then spoon two tablespoons of pease pudding next to the purée. Cut each pork tenderloin in half and lay a piece on top of the pease pudding. Spoon some baby carrots over the pork fillet, garnish with pea shoots and finish with a little drizzle of rapeseed oil.
