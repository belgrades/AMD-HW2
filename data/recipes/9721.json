Pour the boiling water over the tea bags and set aside for five minutes to allow the tea to infuse.  In a food processor, blend the infused water with the figs, dates and apricots until you have a loose paste. Add the remaining ingredients and blend to a thick batter. Divide the mixture between the moulds and place on a baking sheet. Cook in the oven for 25-30 minutes. For the toffee sauce, in a pan over a medium heat warm the butter, sugar and cream, stirring continuously until all the sugar has dissolved. Bring to a rolling boil for two minutes, again stirring constantly. Sieve into a bowl and set aside. To serve, turn out the puddings onto the serving plates and drizzle over the toffee sauce.
