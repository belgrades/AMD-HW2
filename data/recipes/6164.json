Grease and line a small 20cm x 10cm\/8in x4in baking tray. In a food processor, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Add the egg and flour and beat together until well combined. Stir in the chopped walnuts and orange zest. Spread the mixture thinly onto the baking tray, using a palette knife to even out. Bake in the oven for ten minutes, or until firm to the touch and a skewer, when inserted, comes out clean. Turn out onto a wire rack and allow to cool before slicing into four pieces.  For the candied fruit, place the sugar into a small non-reactive pan and heat until the sugar has melted. Add the slices of orange to the pan and cook for ten minutes, or until the sugar is caramelised.  To serve, place two galettes on two serving plates and lay the candied orange on top. Spoon over a bit of the cooking syrup and finish with a spoonful of yoghurt.
