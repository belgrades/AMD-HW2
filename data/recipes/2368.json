Pour the liquid over the mixed fruits and leave to soak for a couple of hours. Mix the yoghurt with the cream and honey, then mix in with the soaked fruits.  Spoon the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn at the 'freeze' setting for 15-20 minutes.  Remove it from the freezer and put into a smallish pudding basin, and either put the lid on the basin, or cover with cling film. Freeze. To serve, wrap the basin in a hot cloth to loosen it and turn the pudding out onto a dish. Place some holly in the top and, if you want, pour some warmed brandy round the bottom and light it, to serve.
