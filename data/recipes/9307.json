In a bowl, mix the spices and seasoning together, then dust the chicken in the spice mixture. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chicken and fry skin-side down for 4-5 minutes. Turn and cook for 4-5 minutes on the other side, or until completely cooked through. For the salsa, mix all the salsa ingredients together in a small bowl. For the grilled sweet potatoes, cut the sweet potatoes into wedges and blanch in boiling salted water for 4-5 minutes. Drain and place into a bowl. Drizzle the sweet potatoes in olive oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a griddle pan and cook the sweet potatoes for five minutes, turning occasionally, or until golden-brown on all sides and tender. To serve, place the grilled sweet potatoes onto a serving plate, top with the blackened chicken and pour over the pineapple salsa. Garnish with chives.
