Put a large wire rack on a baking tray and keep it warm in the oven.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Whisk in the eggs, milk and butter and combine thoroughly. Mix in the smoked salmon and chives. Ladle the batter into each well of the waffle maker and close the lid. Cook the waffles for 5 minutes, then lift the lid and check the waffle – it should be golden-brown and crisp. Transfer to the wire rack in the oven and repeat the process with the remaining batter. For the pancetta, preheat the grill to high. Place the pancetta on a lined tray and grill for 6-7 minutes until crisp, turning once.  Serve the waffles with the pancetta, maple syrup and ice cream.
