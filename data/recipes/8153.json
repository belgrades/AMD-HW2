Place them in an oven for about 3 minutes or until golden brown.  In a small pan reduce some lamb stock to serve as a thin gravy. Take a circular cutter, cut into the gratin and place it off centre on a serving plate. Lay the cutlets alongside the gratin and drizzle a small amount of lamb stock on the plate, eat immediately.
