Heat a small amount of olive oil in a frying pan and fry the trout for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through, then remove from the heat and set aside in a warm place.  For the sesame and honey-coated vegetables, heat the oil in a small wok or frying pan, add the carrots and leeks and stir fry for 3-4 minutes. Add the mangetout, cover with a lid and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Add the soy sauce, sesame seeds and honey and stir well to mix.
