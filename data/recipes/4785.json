Cream the sugars and butter together until light and fluffy.  Add the egg and maple extract and stir to combine. Sift in the flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon and mix to form a dough.  Roll the dough to 1cm\/½in thickness and shape it to resemble a piece of toast. Carefully place on the baking tray.  Brush the top of the dough with the beaten egg. Sprinkle with cinnamon, demerara sugar and cocoa.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden all over but still soft in the middle.  Leave to cool for a few minutes before removing from the tray and placing on a wire rack.  For the ‘baked beans', mix together the icing sugar, a little food colouring and water to make a paste. Add the jelly beans and mix together.  Just before serving, heat a large pan and fry the bacon until crisp. To serve, pour the maple syrup in a jug and place the bacon and ‘baked beans’ alongside the cookie.
