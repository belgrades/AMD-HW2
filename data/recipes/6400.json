Brush the pork chop with oil and add to the griddle to cook for six minutes. Turn the chop over and cook for a further six minutes, or until browned and cooked through. When cooked, the juices will run clear when pierced with a sharp knife. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest for three minutes. For the pepper sauce, heat the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Once the butter has foamed, add the red pepper and onion and sauté for six minutes, until softened.  Transfer the red pepper and onion into a food processor and blend to a smooth purée. Add the tomato ketchup, cream and white wine and blend again briefly to mix.  To serve, place the pork onto a plate and drizzle over the pepper sauce.
