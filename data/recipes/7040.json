{"recipe_name":"Pollo alla Romana with gnocchi","author":"Jo' Pratt","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat the olive oil in a shallow casserole dish or large, deep frying pan. Add the chicken pieces and fry, turning occasionally, until golden-brown on all sides. Add the garlic, capers, olives, oregano and red pepper and stir well.  Add the wine, and simmer until it has reduced in volume by half.  Stir in the tomatoes, breaking them up slightly with a wooden spoon.  Season with salt and pepper then cover loosely with a lid and simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. For the gnocchi, grease a large baking dish with a little of the butter.  Place the milk in a saucepan and heat until it is almost boiling. (Do not boil.)  Add the semolina, stirring all the time to prevent any lumps from forming.  Continue to cook over a low heat for about ten minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture has become a fairly firm but smooth ball. Remove the pan from the heat and mix in 60g\/2oz of the butter, 60g\/2oz of the parmesan cheese, the egg yolk and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Tip the mixture out onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and smooth out to create a layer 2cm\/1in thick. Leave to cool at room temperature for about one hour to firm up slightly. Using a pastry cutter 3cm\/1¼in diameter, cut out discs of the gnocchi mixture, reshaping and re-rolling the trimmings to make sure you use up of all of the mixture. Meanwhile, place the tomatoes into a saucepan with the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Break the tomatoes down just a little with a wooden spoon and cook for about ten minutes, until thickened. Place the gnocchi into the greased baking dish, overlapping slightly so you have just one layer of gnocchi discs.  Top with the tomato sauce and remaining 40g\/1½oz parmesan and dot over lumps of the remaining butter.  Add a twist of black pepper and place into the oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until the edges are golden. Remove from the oven, scatter the basil over the chicken and gnocchi dishes and serve.
