Remove from the processor and pull the mixture together into a dough, then knead for five minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a bowl, cover with cling film and allow to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Using a pasta machine, roll the dough out according to the machine instructions, passing it through several times and ending on the thinnest setting. Place the sheet of pasta dough on a floured work surface and cut into 30-35cm\/12-14in lengths. Run once more through the pasta machine with the cutting attachment, to cut into 2-3mm\/1\/8in wide strips. For the scallops, remove the scallops from the shells, reserving the coral. Wash the scallops and pat dry, then set aside. Roughly chop the prawns. Heat a large frying pan until hot, add half the butter, the shallot, thyme and cook for 2-3 minutes until just softened but not coloured. Add the scallop coral and chopped prawns and cook for a minute. Add the brandy and flame to burn off the alcohol. Add the chopped tomatoes and chicken stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 8 minutes. Place in a food blender in batches and blitz to a puree. Press through a fine sieve into a saucepan, whisk in the cream and check the seasoning. Add the tomato concassé and the courgettes and cook through for two minutes until just tender. Heat a frying pan until medium hot, add the remaining butter and scallops and cook on each side for a minute until golden brown then remove and rest for a couple of minutes. Season the scallops with salt and black pepper. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, drop the pasta in and cook for two minutes until just cooked through. Drain the pasta and mix with the sauce, to coat the pasta thoroughly. Season with salt and black pepper. To serve, pile the linguine onto a pasta plate. Cut the scallops into quarters then scatter on top of the pasta, finishing with a handful of chopped basil.
