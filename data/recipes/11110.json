Add the strawberries, and boil for another five minutes, or until the berries are very tender and the liquid has almost evaporated again. Add the sugar and lemon juice, bring to the boil and cook until the mixture reads 105C\/220F on a sugar thermometer. Stir frequently to check the mixture isn’t sticking on the bottom of the saucepan.
