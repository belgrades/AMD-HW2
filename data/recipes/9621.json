Add the Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce to the pan and stir well. Add the red wine and stock and bring to the boil. Boil until reduced by one-third. Add the brandy and carefully set light to it to burn off the alcohol. Allow the flames to subside, then add the cream and boil over a high heat for about three minutes, until the sauce is the thickness of single cream. Fold in the parsley and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Return the steaks to the pan and warm through but do not boil. Place the steaks on a warmed plate, top with the sauce and serve with French fries and buttered peas.
