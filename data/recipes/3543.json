Heat the oil in a large, lidded, ovenproof frying pan or shallow casserole over medium–low heat. Cook the onion and garlic for 5–10 minutes, or until soft.  Add the ham and paprika and fry for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and tomato purée, cover the pan and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the tomatoes are reduced and pulpy. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to the boil. Add the peas and beans cook for 3–4 minutes, then drain and refresh in cold water (frozen peas do not require pre-cooking). Scatter the peas and beans over the tomato sauce. Break the eggs into the sauce. Arrange the chorizo slices and red pepper strips around the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the egg whites are set and the yolks still soft; check after 8 minutes. Alternatively, cook on the hob over a medium heat with a lid on the pan for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, rub the bread with the garlic, brush with the oil and griddle it on a ridged pan or in a frying pan.  Scatter the parsley over the dish and serve with griddled bread.
