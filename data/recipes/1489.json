{"recipe_name":"Cavatelli with broccoli and colatura (anchovy sauce)","author":"Francesco Mazzei","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Place the semolina flour into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle, then slowly mix in enough warm water to form a firm dough.  Turn the pasta out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in cling film and set aside to rest for about 2 hours. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Flour the pasta machine and feed each piece through to form cavatelli. Set aside the pasta on a lightly floured tray and cover with a tea towel as you work through the remaining dough.  Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the cavatelli and broccoli and blanch for 1-2 minutes.  Heat a frying pan over a high heat and add the olive oil. Fry the garlic and chilli for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown. Add the chopped anchovies and cook, stirring frequently, until they break down in the pan.  Drain the pasta and broccoli, reserving some of the pasta cooking liquid, and add to the pan. Add the colatura and mix well, then add a splash of the pasta cooking liquid. Stir well to coat the pasta in the sauce.  To serve, spoon the pasta onto serving plates and sprinkle over the grated bottarga.
