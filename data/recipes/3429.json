Whisk in enough fizzy cold water to make a batter the consistency of double cream. Heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed pan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dip each fig into the batter, then carefully place into the hot oil. Deep fry for 2-3 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towel. Serve at once with scoops of vanilla ice cream.
