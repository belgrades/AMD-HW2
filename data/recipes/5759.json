For the mini flan, brush each sheet of filo pastry with some of the olive oil. Layer the sheets inside a 12cm\/5in lightly oiled chefs' ring on a baking sheet. Leave the edges of the pastry hanging over the edge of the chefs' ring. Spoon the peas, chopped peppers, crumbled cheese and capers into the middle of the pastry and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Scrunch the edges of the pastry together over the filling to make a parcel, brush with a little more olive oil and then bake in the oven for ten minutes or until golden-brown and crisp.  Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly and then remove the chefs' ring. For the pea purée, place the butter, peas and cream into a small pan. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and boil for five minutes. Pour into a blender and process until smooth. To serve, spoon the pea purée into the middle of a serving dish, place the filo tart on top and garnish with lemon zest and chopped parsley.
