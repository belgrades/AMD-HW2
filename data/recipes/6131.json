{"recipe_name":"Open Kent stawberry tart with clotted cream","author":"Rob Kirby","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Roll out pastry (to about  25-30cm\/10-12in straight edge)  and place over a large greased pastry ring, overlaying the edges to allow for shrinkage. Rest in the fridge. Place baking beans or rice in greaseproof paper and push into the pastry ring, making sure to fill all the edges (this stops the pastry from rising and allows it to cook). Put in the oven at 170C\/325F\/Gas 3 and cook completely until golden brown.  Remove baking beans and allow to cool. Whip the egg yolks and castor sugar, fold in the flour slowly and mix with a wooden spoon. Boil the cream, pour into the egg mixture and mix. Add the vanilla pods or essence, place the mixture onto the stove and stir continuously, making sure to cook out the flour. The cream should thicken as it cooks - this should take 3-5 minutes to form a thick consistency. Allow to cool and place in fridge.  Cut the strawberries into halves. Place the filling inside the pastry case and smooth off. Neatly arrange the cut strawberries on top.  Gently warm the jam and brush it over the strawberries to glaze. Take the whole tart to your picnic, top with clotted cream and serve!
