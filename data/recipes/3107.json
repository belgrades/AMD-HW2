(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.) Dry the noodles with kitchen towel to get rid of any excess water. Deep fry the noodles in the hot oil for 2-3 minutes, until golden. Remove carefully from the oil and drain on kitchen towels. For the skewers, thread the prawns and bamboo shoots on skewers (slice the bamboo if required to fit onto skewers). Place a griddle pan onto a high heat. Coat the prawns and bamboo shoots with the oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place onto the hot griddle pan and season and cook for three minutes on each side, until the prawns are thoroughly cooked. For the spring onion place them onto the griddle pan with the oil and cook until browned. To serve place the crispy noodles on a plate. Top with the grilled spring onion and prawn skewers. Garnish with the lime wedges.
