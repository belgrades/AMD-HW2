Weigh and measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 5.   Break the egg gently into a cup. Then separate the egg by making a claw shape with one hand and hold it over a bowl. Then pour the whole egg into your hand and catch the yolk, letting the white drip down into the bowl. (You can put the yolk aside for another recipe.)   Whisk the egg white with a fork to make some bubbles. Add the oil and milk and mix again.   Add the vanilla extract. Take six raspberries and put them to one side. Put the remaining raspberries into the egg white mixture – you can crush them a little to make the mixture go pink. In another mixing bowl, stir together the self-raising flour and sugar. Tip the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and stir until completely mixed. The mixture will be quite wet. Put the ice cream cones into a 500g loaf tin so they stand up straight. Add a raspberry to the bottom of each cornet. Divide the cake batter equally among the ice cream cones using two spoons – one to scoop it up and one to push it in. Now add one raspberry on the top of each as decoration. Ask a grown-up to put them in the oven for 20-25 minutes. Leave to cool. Serve the cakes with extra fresh raspberries.
