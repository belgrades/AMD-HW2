Drain and plunge into cold water, drain again then toss with a little sesame oil. Using a cleaver, slice the chicken breasts into fine shreds approximately 5cm (2 in) long.  To marinate the chicken, combine the chicken with the light soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Mix well and leave to marinate for 20 minutes. Heat a wok until it is very hot. Add one tablespoon of oil and, when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add chicken shreds. Stir-fry the mixture for about two minutes, then transfer to a plate.  Reheat the wok, and add remaining oil. Add the garlic and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Add the mangetout and ham and fry for one minute. Add noodles, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine, salt and pepper, the sugar and spring onions and continue to stir-fry for two minutes.  Return chicken to noodle mixture. Continue to fry for 3-4 minutes, until chicken is cooked.  Stir in sesame oil and give a few final stirs. Turn onto warm serving platter and serve at once.
