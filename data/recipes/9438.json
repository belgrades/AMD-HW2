Mix with oil. Rub spices into lamb. Leave to marinate for ten minutes. In a hot griddle pan, place the marinated meat and cook for five minutes turning once. Then rest for four minutes. To make the herby couscous, in a bowl mix the couscous with lemon and lime zest and orange juice. Pour over the hot vegetable stock and cover and leave to stand for three minutes. Fluff with a fork. For the chard, start by coating the chard in the flour. Then place into the egg. Coat the chard completely in couscous. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place into the fryer for 2-3 minutes until golden.  Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Serve the crunchy chard with the couscous on top of the lamb.
