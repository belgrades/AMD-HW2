Mix the salt, ground star anise and the orange zest together and rub well into the skin, making sure the salt goes into all the cuts of the pork rind. Using a mini-blender or a pestle and mortar, add the bay leaves, garlic, Szechuan peppercorns, five spice and blend to a paste, then slowly add the olive oil while mixing. Leave the pork to dry overnight in the fridge; do not cover as you want it to dry. Heat a barbecue or griddle and slice the pork into thin slices. Place the pork slices onto the hot griddle or barbeque and brush with the marinade. Cook each side for a few minutes, or until cooked through and the skin is crisp.
