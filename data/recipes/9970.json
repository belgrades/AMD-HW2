Bring the edges of the muslin together, tie with a piece of string and hang over the bowl. Leave for six hours to drain. Reserve the liquid consommé collected in the bowl. For the tapenade, blend all of the ingredients in a food processor, adding just enough olive oil until it forms a paste, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. For the salad, slice the tomatoes into different sized pieces. Slice the asparagus, radish and fennel and place them in a bowl of cold, iced water to chill. When ready to serve, drain.
