{"recipe_name":"‘Nduja and mozzarella pizza","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Makes 4-6 large pizzas","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pizza dough, sift the flours, sugar and salt into a large bowl and mix well. Mix the yeast and a splash of the water in a small jug. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and add the yeast paste. Gradually pour over the rest of the tepid water, bringing the dry ingredients into the centre a little at a time, until the mixture comes together as a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a large, clean bowl and cover with a damp, clean tea towel. Set aside in a warm room to prove for 1½ hours. When the dough has almost doubled in size, knock it back by punching and kneading it a little, and then divide it into 4-6 equal balls (depending on how many pizzas you want to make).  Place the dough balls on a lightly greased baking tray, spaced well apart, and cover with a lightly greased sheet of cling film. Set aside to prove again, for at least 4 hours (in a warm room) or overnight (in the fridge).  When the dough balls have doubled in size again, preheat the oven to its highest setting. Place a heavy baking tray or pizza stone into the oven to heat up.  Roll one of the dough balls out onto a lightly floured work surface to a 0.5cm\/¼in thickness. Sprinkle a little flour onto an upturned baking tray and transfer the pizza base onto it.  Spoon some of the tomato mixture into the centre of the pizza base, spreading it almost to the edges. Sprinkle some of the mozzarella cheese, ’ndjua sausage and basil leaves onto the pizza, then drizzle over the peanut oil.  Working as quickly as possible, move the pizza into the oven by sliding it from the upturned tray onto the pizza stone or hot baking tray. Cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the base is cooked through, the cheese has melted and the tomatoes are bubbling.  Meanwhile, repeat the process with the remaining pizza bases, serving each pizza immediately.
