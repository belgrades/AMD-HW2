{"recipe_name":"Seared squid, chorizo and chickpea purée","author":"Paul Merrett","programme":"Economy Gastronomy","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the chickpea purée, place the chickpeas, cumin, chilli flakes and one of the garlic cloves into a food processor.  With the motor running, gradually add the olive oil in a thin stream and blend until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Season, to taste, with salt. Cover and chill in the fridge until needed. For the yoghurt dip, in a bowl, mix together the Greek-style yoghurt and chopped coriander until well combined. Cover and chill in the fridge until needed. For the squid and chorizo, heat the oil in a large, non-reactive frying pan over a high heat. Add the chorizo and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until dark golden-brown, then remove from the pan and set aside.  Drain the chorizo-infused oil from the pan and reserve. Add the squid rings to the pan the chorizo was cooked in and stir fry for 3-4 minutes, or until just opaque.  Add the cooked chorizo, tomatoes and the remaining crushed clove of garlic to the pan and continue to stir fry for a further minute, or until the squid rings are pale golden-brown. (NB: Take care not to overcook the squid or it will be chewy.)  Add a little of the reserved chorizo-infused oil, to taste, and the lemon juice and stir to combine. Remove from the heat. To serve, place a dollop of the chickpea purée into the centre of each of four serving plates. Dot the squid and chorizo mixture around the chickpea purée. Place a teaspoonful of the coriander yoghurt alongside. Serve with the salad leaves.
