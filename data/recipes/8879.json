{"recipe_name":"Simple white loaf and goats’ cheese and rosemary rolls","author":"Nigel Slater","programme":"Nigel and Adam's Farm Kitchen","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Makes 1 medium loaf and 6 bread rolls","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Mix the flour, yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Measure out 700ml\/1¼ pints of water. Add almost all the water and mix to a sticky dough. Continue to mix for a further minute or so - the dough will gradually become less sticky. Add a touch more flour or water until you are left with a dough that is soft and springy, yet slightly sticky to the touch. Flour a large work surface and gently knead the dough for 10 minutes without treating it aggressively. It should feel soft, smooth, light and springy. Place the dough in a clean bowl, cover it with cling film and leave it to prove for an hour in a warm place. When the dough has doubled in size, tip it back onto a floured surface. Knead it again for 30 seconds. Cut the dough in half. Lay one half of the dough into the base of the loaf tin. Leave in a warm place under a tea towel for 45 minutes, or until it has risen to generously fill the tin. For the rolls, work the rosemary and cheese into the second piece of dough so that they are evenly distributed. Cut the dough into six and shape into small rolls. Lay the rolls on a floured baking tray, leaving a good amount of space between them.  Decorate each roll with a few rosemary needles on top. Leave to rise in a warm place under a tea towel for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 220C\/425F\/Gas 7. Bake all the dough together for 30 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown. Turn onto a wire rack to cool.
