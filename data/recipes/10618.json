Tip the chocolate pieces into a bowl.   Pour the cream into a pan and bring to a rolling boil.   Pour over the chocolate and stir until all the chocolate is melted.  If you want to add booze, mix it in at this point. Allow the mixture to cool at room temperature - this will take about 1Â½ hours - by which time it should be set. Using a melon baller or teaspoon, scoop out bite-sized pieces.  Dust your hands with icing sugar to stop them sticking and roll the pieces into balls. Roll in sifted icing sugar, cocoa or crushed nuts and place them on the prepared tray. Once they are set you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week.
