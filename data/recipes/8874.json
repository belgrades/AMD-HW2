Peel and chop the garlic, peel the ginger and slice it into discs.  In a bowl, mix the garlic, ginger and all of the other ingredients, apart from the cornflour and mushrooms. Add 20ml\/3¾fl oz water and pour over the beef. Cover with cling film and set aside for at least 1 hour, or place in the fridge overnight.  Preheat the oven to 150C\/130C Fan\/Gas 2.  Put the ribs and marinde in an ovenproof dish, place over a medium heat and simmer for 5 minutes.   Remove from the heat and cover tightly with tin foil. Cook in the oven for about 3 hours until the meat is tender and just falling of the bone (check every 15 minutes after 2½ hours). If it is looking a little dry just add some more water.  Remove from the oven and separate the ribs from the juices. Turn the oven off and keep the ribs warm in the oven.  Sieve the juices into a pan and place over a low heat. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the corn flour to make a runny paste and add to the pan. Slice the mushrooms in half and also add these to the pan. Simmer gently for 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken. Season with salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the warm beef. Serve with rice and your favourite green vegetables.
