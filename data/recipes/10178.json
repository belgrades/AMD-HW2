At the same time, bring a pot of water to a boil and drop in the pasta to cook for two or three minutes until just tender. Drain the pasta and stir it into the kale with the lemon zest and juice, the chickpeas and half of the grated pecorino. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve the pasta in deep bowls with more cheese scattered over.
