Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Heat the water and butter in a saucepan until the butter has melted.   Beat in the flour, sugar and salt until the mixture is smooth, then continue to cook for 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the eggs, one at a time, until smooth and glossy.  Set aside to cool, then spoon the dough into a piping bag fitted with a medium size nozzle. Pipe 12.5cm\/5in lines onto the baking tray and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove the éclairs from the oven and set aside to cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, heat the dark chocolate and two tablespoons of water in a saucepan until the chocolate has melted. Sieve the icing sugar and cocoa into a bowl, then add the melted chocolate and water and beat until the mixture is smooth and thickened. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag. Whip the double cream in a bowl until stiff peaks just form when the whisk is removed. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a small nozzle. Carefully insert the nozzle into the base of the éclairs and fill with cream.  Pipe the fondant chocolate on top of the éclairs and set aside until set.
