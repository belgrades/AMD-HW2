Gently fry the onion in olive oil until golden. Add in the minced beef and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 10-15 minutes. Allow meat to cool. Mix the cooked meat with the ricotta cheese, mascarpone, nutmeg and parmesan cheese in a large clean bowl. Taste the mixture and then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Take a sheet of pasta and at one end place two heaped tablespoons of meat mix. Gently roll the pasta to achieve a filled tube shape. Place in a deep-sided baking tray. Repeat the process until the baking tray is full and the pasta sheets are all used up. Pour over the chopped tomatoes.

For the first 10 minutes cover with foil, then remove. To serve, place three cannelloni on a plate and top with shaved parmesan and (if you like) a glass of Italian medium red wine.
