{"recipe_name":"Lamb breast with vegetables and an egg vinaigrette","author":"Matt Tebbutt","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the lamb breast, put the lamb in a large saucepan or casserole and add the bay leaf, onion, carrot and celery and enough water to cover the lamb breast. Cook over a medium heat for 1-2 hours or until cooked through. For the egg vinaigrette, put the soft egg yolks in a food processor. Add the garlic and mustard and blend. Gradually add the oil until you have a runny dressing (you may need more oil if the dressing isn't coming together). Remove the dressing from the machine and put in a bowl. Dice the egg whites and stir into the dressing. Season with salt and pepper. When the lamb is almost cooked, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C or heat the oil in a deep-sided, heavy bottomed pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not over-fill the pan or leave unattended). Remove the lamb from the liquid and discard the bones and sinew. Cut the lamb breast into fingers and pass through the flour, then egg and then coat in breadcrumbs. Just before serving, deep fry the lamb fingers for 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown and crisp. Meanwhile, for the vegetables, heat a large saucepan of salted boiling water and blanch the baby leeks and asparagus for 1-2 minutes. Drain and set aside until ready to serve. Heat the butter in a frying pan. Once hot and melted, gently fry the leeks and asparagus for 1-2 minutes. To serve, put the lamb on a serving plate and pour the vinaigrette over the top. Garnish with the vegetables and anchovies.
