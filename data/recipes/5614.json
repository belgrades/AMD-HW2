Add the onion and garlic and fry for 6-8 minutes, or until softened but not coloured.

Add the garam masala, chilli powder and ground turmeric and fry for a further 2-3 minutes, or until fragrant.  Add the canned tomatoes and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened. Stir the meatballs into the spicy tomato sauce until coated and continue to simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until warmed through.
