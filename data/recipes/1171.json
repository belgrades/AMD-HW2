(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended!) Place the flour, cumin seeds and sesame seeds into a large bowl and mix together. Add the sparkling water and whisk vigorously to form a batter. Dip the broccoli florets into the batter and carefully place into the hot oil and deep-fry in batches, so as not to overcrowd the pan.  Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen towels. To serve, place into a warm bowl.
