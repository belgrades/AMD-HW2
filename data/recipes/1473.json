Add the tomatoes and maple syrup, season with salt and pepper and let them soften for five minutes. Set aside until ready to serve, warm or cold. For the cauliflower as couscous, core the cauliflower and divide it into florets. Chop finely, either by hand or in a food processor. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add the curry powder and stir quickly, then add the chopped cauliflower, vinegar and maple syrup. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir quickly over a medium heat for five minutes until the cauliflower is just tender.  For the kale and feta spiced fritters, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the kale leaves for two minutes, or until tender, then drain and refresh under cold running water. Squeeze out any excess moisture and chop the leaves roughly.  Sift the gram flour and spices into a large bowl along and add a pinch of salt. Add the milk slowly, stirring all the time to make a thick batter. Stir in the crumbled feta, followed by the chopped kale. Season well with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and drop in tablespoons of the batter to make small fritters. Cook for a few minutes on each side.  To serve, place the ‘couscous’ in a bowl and stir through the apple, spring onions and fresh herbs. Stack the fritters on each serving plate with a little chutney between each layer.
