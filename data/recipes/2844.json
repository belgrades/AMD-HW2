Heat half of the butter in a non-stick frying pan, place a ladleful of batter into the pan, swirl around to coat the base of the pan and cook for one minute on each side, or until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining mixture to make a second pancake. To serve, place the pancakes onto a plate with the chopped clementine and a dollop of Greek yoghurt.
