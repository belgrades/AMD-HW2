{"recipe_name":"Sherry-steamed razor clams with a chorizo and red pepper sauce and samphire","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the razor clams, heat a lidded saucepan until hot, add the clams and sherry and cover. Steam the clams for a minute, or until they have opened. Pour into a colander and drain, reserving the cooking liquor.  Discard any clams that haven’t opened, then pull the clams from the shells. Reserve half the shells and clean them thoroughly. Cut off the dark grey part of the clams and discard. Rinse the clams to remove any remaining grit, then roughly chop the flesh. Lay the reserved shells on a baking tray and place the meat back in the shells. Heat a frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the garlic and shallots and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the chorizo and cook until it starts to realise its oils and colour. Stir in the rosemary, thyme and smoked paprika and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the pepper and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the reserved clam cooking liquor and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve. For the samphire, bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the samphire and cook for 2-3 minutes. Drain, place back in the pan and add the butter. Cook for 2 minutes. To serve, divide the samphire between four plates and place the razor clams on top. Pour over the sauce and garnish with parsley cress.
