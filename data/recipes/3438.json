Using a very small, oven-proof frying-pan as a guide, cut a round from a sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry, leaving an extra inch width around. Place the small, oven-proof frying-pan over a medium heat and add the butter and sugar. Add the figs cut side down and cook for four minutes allowing the sugar to caramelise. Place the pastry round over the frying pan and cut a small air hole in the centre. Transfer to the oven and bake for ten minutes, or until the pastry is golden.
