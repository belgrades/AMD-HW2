Once the squash is tender, drain off two inches of liquid and blend smooth with a stick blender or a food processor.   Return to the heat if necessary, and cook down slowly to reduce to a ketchup consistency.  Check the seasoning and add salt, pepper and vinegar as required. Put the ketchup in a clean, plastic tub or sterile glass jar and keep in the fridge for up to two weeks. For the peelings, wash and drain the peelings well and then dry the peelings by removing excess water with a tea towel. Add an inch or so of oil to a deep saucepan and heat to about 160C\/325F, or until a small piece of peeling sizzles when added to the oil. (Caution: Do not leave hot oil unattended). Fry the potato peelings in small batches until crisp, golden-brown and crunchy.  Drain well on kitchen paper and season with salt and pepper.  Serve the potato peelings with the squash ketchup for dipping and a little sprinkling of chilli powder or smoked paprika.
