{"recipe_name":"Herb-roasted chicken thighs with ratatouille and olive and red wine sauce","author":"Paul Rankin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the chicken, lightly oil the chicken thighs with one tablespoon of the oil, then roll in the chopped herbs to coat. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Heat the remaining oil in an ovenproof frying pan and place the chicken in skin-side down. Press down on the chicken with a spatula and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until the skin is crisp. Turn over and fry for another 3-4 minutes, then transfer to the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. The juices should run clear when the chicken is pierced at its thickest point. For the ratatouille, in a another pan gently fry the onion and garlic in the oil over a medium heat until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the courgette and aubergine and fry until they start to take on some colour, about five minutes. Stir in the chopped tomato, tomato purée, water and olives. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes before stirring through the fresh basil. For the olive and red wine sauce, bring the wine in a pan to the boil and crumble in the stock cube, stirring until the cube has dissolved. Add the hot water, then reduce the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes before stirring in the olives. To serve, place the chicken thighs on a serving plate and spoon the ratatouille on the side. Drizzle the olive red wine sauce around the edge of the plate and serve.
