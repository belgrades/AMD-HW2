Add the mustard seeds and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, then pour in the beer and bring the mixture to the boil. Blend the mixture in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Heat a medium frying pan and add the butter. Once hot and melted, add the shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the white wine and simmer until the volume of liquid is reduced by half. Add two tablespoons of the mustard and all the cream, then continue to heat for a couple of minutes to reduce it in volume . For the roasted loin of pork, preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6.  Heat the oil in a frying pan. Fry the pork on all sides for a few minutes to seal it. Then cook it in the oven for 4-7 minutes. Set aside to rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile bring a pan of water to the boil and boil the potatoes for 10 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain the potatoes. Put the cream and butter into a saucepan and warm until the butter is fully melted. Mash the potatoes and add the cream and butter mixture slowly, beating to incorporate. Heat a large saucepan of boiling water and season with salt. Add the beans and cook for 2-3 minutes. Place some of the mustard onto a plate. Once the beans have been cooked, drain them and roll them in the mustard. To serve, place the beans and potatoes on serving plates. Once the meat has rested, cut it into portions and place on the plates. Pour over the mustard sauce and garnish with mustard cress.
