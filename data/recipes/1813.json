{"recipe_name":"Chicken goujons with almond satay sauce and a ponzu dressing","author":"Glynn Purnell","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Mix the vegetables together and set aside.  For the ponzu dressing, mix all the ingredients together, pour into a container and set aside.  For the almond satay, melt the butter and oil in a saucepan. Add the shallot and garlic and gently fry until soft, but not coloured. Add the ginger and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the almonds, honey, stock, soy sauce and lime juice. Cook for 2 minutes more or until combined. Remove from the heat, then stir in the chilli and coriander. Set aside. For the chicken goujons, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dredge the chicken strips in the flour, then dip in the egg and coat in breadcrumbs. Lower the chicken goujons into the hot oil (you may need to do this in batches) and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the breadcrumbs golden-brown. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Serve the chicken goujons with the raw vegetables alongside. Pour over a spoonful of warm almond satay, then 3 tablespoons of ponzu dressing. Garnish with a few coriander leaves.
