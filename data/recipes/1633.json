In a bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, goat’s cheese, pistachios and prunes.  In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until fluffy and pale in colour. Then gradually whisk in the oil, milk and yoghurt. Season with the salt and freshly-ground black pepper. Fold the flour mixture into the whisked eggs. Try not to overbeat as this will make the end result tough (it’s better to undermix).  Pour the batter into the prepared tin.  Bake for 30-40 minutes or until a metal skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean.  Leave to cool in the tin.
