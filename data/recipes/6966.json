Beat in the eggs one by one. Sift together the flours and baking powder and fold into the mixture. Take four large souffli or ramekin dishes, about 200ml\/7fl oz in capacity, and divide the maple syrup between them. Top with the plums.  Spoon the ginger mixture over the plums, then cover the dishes with cling-film and place in a saucepan. Pour enough boiling water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes, then cover the pan and simmer gently for 25-30 minutes until a knife inserted in the centre of the pudding comes out clean.  Remove the puddings carefully and allow to cool slightly for about 10 minutes before turning them out on to serving plates. Serve with vanilla ice cream or crème fraîche.
