For the salsa verde, place the parsley, mint, tarragon, capers, anchovies, mustard and olive oil into a food processor and blend to combine. To serve, place a square of pasta onto each plate. Place a spoonful of the filling mixture onto the middle of the pasta square, then top with another piece of pasta. Repeat this process until you have used up all of the pasta squares and filling.
