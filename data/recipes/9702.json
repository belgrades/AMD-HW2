Fold half of the chopped stem ginger into the pudding batter and set aside. Grease a small glass bowl, then spoon a little ginger syrup into the base. Add the remaining chopped stem ginger, then spoon the pudding batter on top. Smooth down the surface with a palatte knife, cover with cling film and cook in the microwave at its highest setting for 4½ minutes, or until risen and cooked through. Remove the cling film and turn the pudding out onto a serving plate. For the chocolate sauce, place the melted chocolate, cream and honey in a bowl and mix until smooth. Pour over the steamed pudding. For the hot toffee sauce, place the butter, sugar, double cream, orange zest and juice into a pan over a low heat and cook until melted and combined to a smooth sauce. To serve, pour the toffee sauce over the pudding and serve.
