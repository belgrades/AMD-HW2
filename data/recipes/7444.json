Add the potatoes and carrots. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain.  Heat the vegetable oil in a very large frying pan. Add the bacon lardons and leftover meat. Fry on a medium-high heat until the bacon has rendered its fat and the meat is well seared. Add the butter to the frying pan. When it has melted, add the onions, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly, then add the potatoes, carrots and sausage.  Spread all of the ingredients out well in the pan, and fry on a medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and thyme and cook for a further few minutes.  Strain the dried mushrooms, reserving their soaking liquor but discarding any gritty sediment. Finely chop the mushrooms and add to the frying pan along with 50ml\/2 fl oz of the cooking liquor. Stir thoroughly so everything is well combined. Season with salt and pepper and cook for a further 5 minutes, until an undercrust has developed, then stir again, scraping up any brown bits on the base of the pan. Repeat, until the carrots and potatoes are completely cooked through and everything is well browned. Divide the mixture between 6 plates and top each serving with an egg yolk.  Serve with a sprinkling of marjoram, lingonberry jam and some pickled beetroot.
