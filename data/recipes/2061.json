{"recipe_name":"Chilli colcannon with grilled sausages, fried egg and deep-fried tomato rings","author":"Lesley Waters","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the chilli colcannon, heat the butter in a pan and stir fry the greens until they start to soften. Add the chilli flakes and nutmeg and stir. Stir in the mashed potato and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry until the mash is turning golden-brown, about 7-8 minutes. For the tomato rings, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Soak the slices of tomato in the milk, then dredge with the flour. Place the tomatoes into the hot oil and deep fry until golden-brown and crisp, about 5-6 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To serve, place the chilli colcannon onto a serving plate and top with the grilled sausages and fried egg. Place the tomato rings around the outside and sprinkle over the chopped chives.
