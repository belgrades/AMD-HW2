{"recipe_name":"Yorkshire puddings with rib of beef and seasonal cabbage","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 6-8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the Yorkshire puddings, place the flour into a bowl and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the eggs and milk to the bowl and whisk to make a smooth batter. Cover and place in the fridge to chill for at least one hour, but preferably overnight. For the beef, preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat a frying pan until very hot. Season the beef with salt and freshly ground black pepper and brush with a little olive oil. Add the beef to the hot pan. Fry on all sides in the hot pan until nicely browned. Transfer the beef to a roasting dish and place in the oven to cook for 1 hour 10 minutes for rare, or longer to suit your taste. Remove the beef from the oven, cover with foil and rest in a warm place for 15-30 minutes. For the Yorkshire puddings, preheat the oven to 220C\/450F\/Gas 7. Divide the dripping or lard between two 12-hole muffin tins or Yorkshire tins and place the tins in the oven for ten minutes until smoking hot. Carefully pour the batter into the tins, filling the tins two-thirds full. Place the tins into the oven and cook the Yorkshire puddings for 20 minutes - do not open the oven door during this time. After 20 minutes, open the door to allow any steam to escape and turn the temperature down to 190C\/375F\/Gas 5. Continue to cook until the Yorkshire puddings are golden-brown and crisp. For the seasonal cabbage, heat a large frying pan and add the butter. Once hot add the cabbage and a little water. Add the caraway seeds and cook for 2-3 minutes until the cabbage has wilted. To serve, carve the beef and place on plates along with the Yorkshire puddings and cabbage. Pour the beef jus or gravy over the beef and puddings.
