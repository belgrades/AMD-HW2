Grease a 1kg\/2lb 2oz loaf tin with butter. In a bowl, mix together the flour and melted butter until well combined. Add the ground ginger, sugar and beaten eggs and beat until well combined.  Add the cream and mix until the mixture forms a smooth, thick batter. Stir in the chopped cobnuts until well combined. Spoon the mixture into the prepared loaf tin, gently spreading the batter into all the corners and shaking the tin to make sure the mixture has settled. Transfer the loaf tin to the oven and bake for 1-1¼ hours, or until the cake has risen and is golden-brown, and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.  Set the cake aside to cool slightly in the tin. Meanwhile, for the apple compôte, heat the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the apples, caster sugar and ground cinnamon and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the apples have broken down slightly and the mixture has thickened. To serve, cut the cake into six to eight slices (it is best served still warm). Serve each slice with a dollop of whipped cream and a spoonful of warm apple compôte.
