{"recipe_name":"Whisky-cured salmon with pickled beetroot, cucumber, shallots and cucumber ketchup","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the whisky cured salmon, put the sugar, salt, vanilla seeds and whisky in a large bowl and mix together. Sprinkle some of the mixture on the bottom of a non-reactive baking tray and lay the salmon on top, skin-side down. Cover the salmon with the rest of the curing mixture and cover with cling film. Place in the fridge for 4-6 hours, or overnight. For the pickled beetroot, cucumber and shallots, put the baby beetroot in a large saucepan of boiling water and cook for 15-20 minutes. Drain and leave until cool enough to handle. Peel carefully and cut in half. For the pickled shallots, heat the white wine vinegar, sugar, salt and peppercorns in a pan over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Put the shallots, cucumber, beetroot and ginger in a bowl and pour over the hot vinegar mixture. Mix together to coat then set aside to pickle for at least an hour, but preferably 24 hours. For the cucumber ketchup, place the vinegar and sugar in a saucepan and heat until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly before pouring it into a large food processor with the cucumber. Blend until smooth. With the processor still running, add the xantham gum until well-combined and thickened. Season with salt and set aside. To serve, slice the salmon into thin strips. Spread the cucumber ketchup on a serving plate and add the salmon. Garnish with the pickled vegetables and cresses.
