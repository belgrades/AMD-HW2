Repeat with the other eggs. Make the hollandaise by putting the egg yolk, lemon juice and water into a blender. Turn on the machine and then slowly pour the warmed butter through the lid. Season with cayenne pepper and salt. Pile 5-6 spears of asparagus on to each toasted brioche. Top with a poached egg. Spoon on the hollandaise sauce and serve.
