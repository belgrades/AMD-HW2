Gently fold the brandy, caster sugar, chopped ginger and ginger syrup into the whipped cream until it is evenly distributed throughout the cream. Fold in the chunks of meringue.  Lightly grease a 570ml\/1 pint pudding basin with the groundnut oil and spoon in the snow queen mixture. Cover the basin with aluminium foil and then with cling film. Chill in the freezer for at least eight hours.  To serve, dip the sides of the pudding basin into hot water to loosen the frozen snow queen mixture, then turn it out onto a serving plate.
