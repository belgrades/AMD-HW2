Freeze until required. Generously butter 8 individual souffli moulds and set aside. Melt the 66% chocolate with the butter in a bowl over hot water then remove from the heat. Beat together the yolks and sugar until light and fluffy and then combine with the melted chocolate. Sift the flour into the mixture. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks then fold into the chocolate mix and stand for approximately 1 hour. (Make in advance). Spoon some chocolate mix into the moulds to come to about ¼ full, then unmould the ice cubes and place one in the centre of each pudding. Now fill the mould up to ¾ full with more chocolate mix. Bake at 180C\/350F\/Gas 4 for 10-12 minutes until the puddings rise. Remove and let rest for a couple of minutes then turn out onto a serving plate. Dust with cocoa or icing sugar and serve.
