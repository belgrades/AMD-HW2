Place the remaining beans in a food processor and blend to a rough paste.  In a small pan, gently fry the chopped onion in a little of the olive oil until softened but not coloured.  Place the blended beans into a large bowl and stir in the reserved whole beans, fried onion, cooked lentils, chopped parsley, thyme, chilli, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper and mix well until combined.  Using your hands, shape the mixture into 7cm\/3in patties, gently flattening the top. Chill in the fridge until required.  To cook, heat four tablespoons of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Fry the cakes for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and cooked through. For the potato wedges, fry the potato wedges in olive oil until golden-brown on each side. Once coloured, add a pinch of chilli flakes, coriander, allspice and season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to a roasting tray and roast in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until crisp. To make the mango salsa, mix the mango, tomatoes, spring onion, lime juice and coriander together in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, add the extra-virgin olive oil and mix. For the mint and lime dressing, place the natural yoghurt in a large bowl. Stir in the chopped mint, lime zest and juice and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, place the bean cakes onto serving plates. Serve the wedges alongside with the mango salsa and a spoonful of mint and lime dressing. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with lime wedges.
