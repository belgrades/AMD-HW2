Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the medallions for 3-4 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown all over and cooked through. Set aside on a warm plate to rest.  For the chips, place the potato pieces into a roasting tin, drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
