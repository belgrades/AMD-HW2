{"recipe_name":"Steamed and griddled swordfish with a fresh mint and marjoram sauce","author":"Gennaro Contaldo","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the swordfish, mix the oil and lemon juice in a bowl and season well with  salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the mint, marjoram and garlic and stir to combine. Pour a little water into a large griddle pan with a lid, so the lines of the griddle pan are just above the water level. Place onto a high heat and bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to simmer gently. Pat dry the slices of swordfish with kitchen paper. Brush each slice with oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the swordfish steaks onto the griddle pan, cover with the lid and cook for a couple of minutes. Remove the lid, brush each swordfish steak with a little more oil, then carefully turn the fish over and brush the other side with a little more oil. Cover with the lid and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, or until the swordfish is cooked to your liking. Remove the swordfish steaks and place onto plates with the sauce spooned around.  For the salad, place all of the salad ingredients into a large bowl and mix well.  For the dressing, place all of the dressing ingredients into a small clean bowl and mix well. Add the dressing to the salad and toss well to coat. Serve the salad alongside the swordfish steaks.
