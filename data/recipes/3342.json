Spoon into a large serving bowl.  For the salsa, place the mango, passion fruit pulp and lime zest and juice into a separate bowl and mix together.  Spoon the salsa over the Eton mess. For the chocolate sauce, add the double cream to the melted chocolate and stir until smooth. Leave to cool slightly, then pour over the Eton mess. For the spun sugar, heat the sugar in a frying pan until it turns a dark caramel colour. Sit the base of the frying pan into cold water briefly to cool it slightly.  Hold an oiled metal steel or ladle handle and wave spoonfuls of the caramel back and forth across it to make fine strands of caramel.  To serve, gently gather the strands of caramel into a loose ball and place on top of the Eton mess.
