Place the tomatoes, cut-side up onto a roasting tray and drizzle with the olive oil. Season with salt and black pepper then scatter half the thyme leaves over the top. Place in the oven and roast for 4-6 hours, or until slightly dried out. Turn the oven off and allow to cool, preferably overnight in the oven. For the chicken escalope, preheat the oven to 220C\/425F\/Gas 7.   Place the breadcrumbs, parmesan and lemon zest into a food processor and pulse to form fine crumbs. Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of cling film or baking parchment and using a rolling pin bash until flattened out. Wrap the chicken breasts in the Parma ham. Season the flour with salt and black pepper then dust the chicken in the flour. Place the beaten egg in a shallow bowl. Dip the chicken in the beaten egg then into the breadcrumbs, making sure to coat each side thoroughly. Heat the olive oil and the butter in a large frying pan then add the chicken breasts, one at a time, and fry for two minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Transfer to the oven to finish cooking. When the chicken is cooked through, place onto kitchen paper to drain. For the tomato and artichoke salad, place the lettuce and baby spinach in a large bowl and add the cooled tomatoes, artichokes and mozzarella balls. In a small bowl combine the vinegars and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Pour the dressing over the salad, add any oil from the artichoke too, and toss to coat. To serve, place the chicken escalope on a serving plate with the salad next to it and a wedge of lemon.
