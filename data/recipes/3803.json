{"recipe_name":"German sticky buns (Schnecken)","author":"Christine Wallace","programme":"The Great British Bake Off","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Makes 12","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the dough, melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat, then add the milk and sugar and heat until tepid. Pour the mixture into a jug and add the yeast. Leave to rest for 8-10 minutes. Stir the salt and the eggs into the yeast mixture. Place the flour in a free-standing food mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add the yeast mixture and mix on a low speed working through the initial wet stage until the dough begins to pull away cleanly from the sides of the bowl and is smooth. Place in a large greased bowl, cover with an oiled cling film, and prove for two hours or more, or until tripled in volume. Grease a 23 x 33 x 3cm\/9 x 13 x 1½in baking tray with oil - if the tin is too shallow, it will ooze over the side. For the sticky topping, melt the butter, brown sugar and golden syrup together in a pan. Spread over the base of the greased baking tray and sprinkle over the pecans. Set aside. For the fruit filling, mix together the cherries, raisins, cinnamon and sugar in a bowl. Set aside. When the dough has risen, knock back and roll out on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle of 30 x 38cm\/12 x 15in. Brush with the dough with melted butter, then evenly spread over the fruit. Roll up, starting with the long side, into a sausage shape.  Place the sausage, seam-side down, and cut into 12 equal pieces using a very sharp knife. Place cut-side up into the prepared pecan pan. Cover with oiled cling film and leave to rise for about 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C\/fan oven 180C\/400F\/Gas 6. Bake the buns for about 35-40 minutes. If browning too quickly, cover with some foil. Turn out of the tray while still warm onto a plate or baking tray.
