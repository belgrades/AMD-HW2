Place the chicken, lime juice, five-spice powder and soy sauce into a food processor and pulse until just combined. Add the pork mince, green chilli and fresh coriander and pulse again to combine well as a rough paste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Form the mince mixture into golf ball-sized balls and flatten slightly into patties. Heat an ovenproof frying pan until hot and add the vegetable oil and mince patties and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown, then transfer to the oven to cook for 4-5 minutes, or until completely cooked through. For the dip, place the chillies, sugar, water and vinegar into a saucepan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until just beginning to thicken, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Meanwhile, for the salad, whisk the lime juice, sesame oil and soy sauce together in a bowl. Add the spring onions, cucumber and coriander leaves and mix together to coat well. To serve, place the salad mixture onto a plate, top with a pile of the pork patties and drizzle with a little of the chilli dip. Place the remaining dip into a small bowl and serve alongside.
