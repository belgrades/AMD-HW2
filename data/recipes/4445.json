Cover and marinate in the fridge, ideally overnight, or for at least an hour. Light the barbecue about 30 minutes before you want to eat, so that the flames die down, the coals have a coating of grey ash and produce a steady heat.  Barbecue the chicken wings for about 10–15 minutes, turning them over when they’re patched with brown. Check they are really cooked through with the tip of a knife – there should be no pink meat and the juices will run clear. Serve with wedges of lime to squeeze over.
