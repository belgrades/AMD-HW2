Bring to a boil, then add the beef. Turn down to a gentle simmer and cook for 2½  hours. Check the pan fairly frequently and stir, adding more water to cover the meat if necessary. Check the meat for tenderness, if not tender add a little more water and cook for a little longer. Remove the meat when done and, if needed, continue to cook the liquid to thicken the sauce.
