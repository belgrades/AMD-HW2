Add the salmon to the mixture, cover and marinade in the fridge for 24 hours. Heat a medium griddle pan, wipe any excess marinade from the salmon and place on the griddle. Cook for three minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.  For the miso aubergine, preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Bake the aubergine for 20 minutes, or until soft. Remove the aubergines and set aside. Cut the baby aubergines in half and place onto a baking tray. Using a sharp knife, score a criss cross pattern on the baby aubergines, place onto the baking tray and cook for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, warm the miso paste, sugar, mirin, soy sauce and ginger in a small pan over a low heat. Scoop out the aubergine flesh and place in a small food processor with two tablespoons of the miso mixture. Blend to a purée and set aside. Preheat the grill to hot.  Spoon the leftover miso mixture over the baby aubergines and place under the grill for twominutes. Serve the aubergine purée topped with the griddled salmon and the baby aubergines on the side. Garnish with the coriander cress and red amaranth.
