Reduce to a simmer. Wrap the pork around the celery heart and secure with a cocktail stick. Add to the stock and poach for ten minutes, or until cooked through. Remove the pork-wrapped celery heart from the stock and set aside. For the spicy celery, heat the oil in a pan and sauté all of the ingredients, except for the apricot and parsley, for five minutes. Add the apricots and the parsley and stir to combine. For the cheese sauce, melt the butter in a small pan. Add the flour and mustard powder, beating for one minute to make a roux. Gradually add the milk, whisking all the time. Bring the mixture to the boil and add the smoked cheese, stirring well, until all has melted. Add the chives and stir though. To serve, place a bed of spicy celery on a plate, top with the pork-wrapped celery heart and spoon over the smoked cheese sauce.
