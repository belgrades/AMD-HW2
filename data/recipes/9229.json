{"recipe_name":"Spatchcocked duck with posh peas and celeriac chips","author":"The Hairy Bikers","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the duck, preheat the oven to 190C\/170C Fan\/Gas 5. Weigh the duck so you can calculate the cooking time later. Place the duck breast-side down. Take a pair of boning shears or strong pair of scissors and cut out the backbone.  Turn the duck over and flatten it out using your hands. The idea is to get the duck as flat as possible. Rub the duck all over with the olive oil, sea salt flakes and cracked pepper.  Place the duck breast-side up on a rack above a roasting tin. Place in the oven for 20 minutes per 500g\/1lb 2oz of duck (so a 1.25kg\/2lb 12oz duck will take 50 minutes). Then turn the oven up as high as it will go and cook the duck for a further 15 minutes, or until the duck is cooked through and the skin is really crisp.  Meanwhile, make the celeriac chips. Blanch the chips in boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain well and put in a roasting tin with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Pop into the oven for 30-40 minutes, until golden-brown. For the duck, the roasting tin will be full of gorgeous duck fat. You can keep this in a sealed container in the fridge to use when making roast potatoes on another day.  Mix the honey, treacle and orange juice together. Brush this all over the duck and cook for a further 5 minutes to glaze. For the posh peas, blanch the onions in boiling water for 3 minutes. In a saut√© pan, heat the oil and butter. Fry the onions until golden-brown, add the shredded lettuce, and stir. Add the frozen peas and stock. Bring to the boil and cook until the peas are tender. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm until ready to serve. Serve the duck in the middle of the table and let people help themselves. Serve with the posh peas and celeriac chips alongside.
