{"recipe_name":"Warm pear tart","author":"Peter Gordon","programme":null,"prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pastry, grease six 10cm\/4in fluted tart cases with melted butter.  In a mixing bowl, rub the butter and cheese into the flour and cornflour, then mix in the icing sugar.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the milk, then add two-thirds of the mixture into the flour mixture. Add more egg mixture as necessary until the mixture comes together as a dough. Bring the mixture together using your hands and knead the dough lightly until smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for one hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 170C\/325F\/Gas 3. Roll the chilled dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut out six 12.5cm\/5in discs using a pastry cutter or upturned bowl as a template. Line each tart case with a pastry disc.  Place a circle of greaseproof paper into each pastry case and fill with dried beans or rice. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, then remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. For the filling, place the pears, ginger and dessert wine in a pan, cover with a lid and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the pears are tender. (The cooking time will vary according to the ripeness of the pear.) Remove the pears from the pan using a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. Turn the heat up and boil the wine until it has reduced by three quarters. Remove from the heat and set aside. Blend the pistachio nuts in a food processor until they resemble breadcrumbs.  Add the icing sugar and butter and blend the mixture to a paste. Add the beaten eggs, flour and molasses and blend until smooth.  Divide the filling among the pastry cases and place one of the poached pear halves on top.  Bake the tarts in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is cooked.
