Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a non-stick frying and fry the venison steak on both sides until cooked to your liking (the cooking time for medium to well-done will be about 6-8 minutes on each side; adjust the cooking time accordingly). Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove the venison steak from the heat and allow to rest for a few minutes. Cut the steak into fine strips and add them to salad. For the sauce, blend the olive oil, raspberries, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice in a blender to combine. Pass through a sieve into a clean bowl to remove the pips. To serve, transfer the salad to a large serving bowl and drizzle the raspberry sauce over.
