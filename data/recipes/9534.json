{"recipe_name":"Splendidly spicy beef burger","author":"Cyrus Todiwala","programme":"Christmas Kitchen with James Martin","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Makes 4 large, or 6 medium burgers","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/food\/ic\/food_16x9_608\/recipes\/splendidly_spicy_beef_28887_16x9.jpg","method":"Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the onions on a medium heat, stirring frequently, until softened and slightly coloured. The small amount of oil used in this recipe means the onions might stick to the pan at some point; add a splash of water if necessary. Add the ginger, garlic and green chilli and continue to fry until cooked and any liquid has evaporated. Transfer the mixture to a plate, spread out and allow to cool. Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and add the potato wedges. Boil for 5-6 minutes, then drain. Place the parboiled potatoes on a baking tray, drizzle with the oil, then toss to coat. Put the tray in the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and crisp.  Mix the ingredients for the spice blend together in a small bowl and set aside until you serve. Put the minced beef in a mixing bowl, add the onion mixture and all of the remaining ingredients, and mix well. (Mixing makes the meat more malleable and smoother; the more you work it, it the smoother it gets.) Shape into four to six burgers.  Heat a griddle pan, hot plate, frying pan or barbecue to hot. Brush the burgers with a little oil and cook: four minutes each side for a medium finish for six burgers, a little longer if you have made four larger burgers.  Rest the burgers for a few minutes while you sprinkle the cooked potato wedges with the spice blend. Serve the burgers in buns, with the wedges alongside and some ketchup for dipping.
