Heat a large griddle pan over a medium heat. Drizzle the porcini and cabbage wedges with oil and cook in the grill pan, turning as you go, until just cooked and lightly charred. Remove from the pan, squeeze over a little lemon juice and set aside. Clean the griddle pan and turn up to maximum heat. Rub the mackerel with olive oil and season well. Place skin side down and cook for 3 minutes to lightly char before turning and cooking for a further 2 minutes. The mackerel should still be a little pink. To serve, pile the porcini, pumpkin and cabbage onto a plate then top with the grilled mackerel and spoon around the romesco sauce.
