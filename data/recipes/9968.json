For the dressing, whisk together all the ingredients with 1 tablespoon water until the sugar dissolves. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat the vegetables. Heat the oil in a heavy-based, deep-sided saucepan to 135C, or until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)  Sprinkle the courgette slices with demerara sugar and fry, in batches if necessary, for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown on each side. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain. Carefully lower the onion slices into the hot oil and fry for 1 minute, or until crisp and golden-brown. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain. Sprinkle with salt. To serve, top each slice of fried courgette with a teaspoonful of the dressed salad, then top the salad with a pinch of the fried onion slices.
