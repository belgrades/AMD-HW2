Slice the monkfish lengthways down the centre, not quite all the way through, to make a pocket. Place two piquillo peppers along the length of each open monkfish fillet and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roll the fillets back up around the peppers. Place the herbs onto a plate and mix to combine. Roll the fillets in the herbs, to cover well. Lay five slices of pancetta onto a piece of aluminium foil, slightly overlapping. Place a stuffed monkfish fillet into the centre of the pancetta and wrap the pancetta over to cover the fish. Wrap up tightly in the foil and place onto a baking tray. Repeat with the remaining pancetta and stuffed monkfish fillets. Heat a frying pan until hot and add the foil wrapped fish. Cook for 15 seconds on each side. Return the parcels to the baking tray and place into the oven to cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the monkfish is cooked through. Serve the parcels still wrapped on plates. Cut the parcels open for your guests to release the aromas and allow them to dig in.
