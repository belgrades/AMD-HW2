Mix together the oil, lemon juice, paprika and parsley in a bowl, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the turkey and turn to coat thoroughly. Set aside in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Preheat the grill to a hot setting. Remove the turkey from the bowl (discard any marinade) and thread the pieces on the skewers. Cook under the grill, turning once or twice, for 10 minutes, or until cooked through. Meanwhile, bring the stock to the boil. Place the bulgur wheat in a medium sized lidded pot and cover with the stock. Cover with the lid and simmer over a medium heat for 12-15 minutes, or until the bulgur wheat is tender and has absorbed the stock. When the bulgur is cooked, drain and spread out to cool. Stir in the green lentils, cucumber, tomatoes and mint. For the dressing, combine the hummus with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water. Place the turkey skewers on the bulgur wheat salad and spoon over the dressing. Garnish with lemon wedges and flat leaf parsley and serve.
