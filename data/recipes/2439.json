Add the mince and brown all over. Increase the heat, add the wine and cook until evaporated. Dilute the tomato purée in a little of the stock and stir into the meat.  Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid and cook on a gentle heat for 2 hours, checking and adding a little extra stock from time to time to prevent the sauce from drying out.   About 10 minutes before the end of cooking time, stir in the milk. Serve with freshly cooked tagliatelle.  For a slow cooker, cook the vegetables and pancetta, and brown the meat as above.  Add the wine and allow to evaporate. Then dilute the tomato purée in 350ml\/12fl oz of stock and add to the meat. Bring to the boil and transfer to a medium slow cooker pot.  Cover and cook on a low setting for 8–9 hours. Stir in the milk and cook for 10 minutes before serving. For a large slow cooker pot, you can make double the quantity, but cooking times remain the same.
