{"recipe_name":"Sticky lamb buns with a pickled cucumber relish","author":"Sabrina Ghayour","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4. For the lamb, rub the lamb all over with oil and place in a roasting tray. Cover with aluminium foil and roast for 1½-2 hours, or until the lamb is tender. Set aside to cool then shred the meat. For the relish, quarter the cucumber lengthways, then thinly slice and place in a bowl along with the onion. Season with a few generous pinches of salt.  Mix well and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Stir again and leave to sit for another 15 minutes. After the resting time, drain off any excess moisture and wrap the cucumber mixture in a clean tea towel or a few sheets of kitchen paper until dry.  Put the cucumber mixture in a bowl, add the vinegar, sugar and sesame oil. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved and the marinade coats the cucumber and onion. Add the nigella seeds, dill and pomegranate seeds and set aside.  For the lamb, put the shredded meat in a saucepan set over a medium heat, add the harissa, honey, cumin and cinnamon and coat the meat in the mixture. (If desired, you can slacken the mixture with a little oil, water or even apple juice, a tablespoon at a time, to soften the texture.) Season with salt, to taste, and, once the consistency has reached a moist and juicy meat mixture, remove from the heat.  Serve the lamb inside the bread rolls with a generous amount of relish.
