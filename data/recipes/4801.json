{"recipe_name":"Jerusalem artichoke soup served with a game burger and Jerusalem crisps","author":"Tom Kitchin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the Jerusalem artichoke soup, heat the vegetable oil in a large pan and gently fry the onion and a pinch of salt for 5-6 minutes, or until soft.  Meanwhile, cut the artichokes into roughly 2cm\/1in cubes. Add them to the onions and fry for a further 3-4 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and cream and cook over a medium heat until the vegetables are soft. Add the lemon juice and cook for five more minutes. Transfer the cooked vegetables to food processor and blend to a smooth soup. If it is too thick, add a little more stock or water. Taste to check the seasoning and add salt and pepper as required. Keep warm until ready to serve. For the game burger, heat a dash of the olive oil in a frying pan. Once hot, add the onion and gently fry until soft and translucent. Set aside to cool. Put the livers, pork fat, throat (or belly), game and apricots through a mincer, or very finely chop them (alternatively, ask your butcher to do this for you). Add one egg, the cream and breadcrumbs and mix together. If the mixture doesn’t bind together add the other egg. Season with salt and pepper or, to test the seasoning of the burger, roll a small amount into a mini burger, fry and taste. When satisfied with the seasoning, mould the meat into burgers and fry in a large frying pan with the olive oil for 2-3 minutes on each side. For the Jerusalem crisps, fill a deep-fat fryer with vegetable oil and preheat to 180C\/350F. (CAUTION: hot can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dry the slices of artichokes with a clean tea towel and dust with flour. Fry for two minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.  Serve the Jerusalem artichoke soup with the game burger in the centre of each of the bowls, garnished with the artichoke crisps, chives and a swirl of olive oil.
