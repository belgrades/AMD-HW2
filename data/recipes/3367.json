Add the remaining ingredients and continue to pulse until you have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs.  Gently form into patties approx. 10cm\/4in in diameter by 2½cm\/1in. thick. Fry in hot oil at 180C\/350F for 4-5 minutes, or until crisp or golden. For the hummus and tahini sauce simply whisk together all the ingredients.  If you prefer a lighter sauce add a little water until it is the preferred consistency. To serve, split and warm the rolls.  Place in the top of each roll a leaf of lettuce, a slice of tomato, and some red onions.   Place the falafel burger on the bottom side of the roll, and some of the sauce.   Either serve side by side on a plate, or built up as a burger on a plate with your choice of accompaniment. Cook and refrigerate or freeze any left over burgers for a quick and easy snack.
