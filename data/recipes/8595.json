Lightly grease a baking tray. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Stir in the sugar and add the butter. Using your fingertips, quickly rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.  Add the milk, a little at a time, working to form a smooth dough. If possible, rest the dough for 5-15 minutes before rolling. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface until 2cm\/¾in thick. Using a 5cm\/2in pastry cutter, cut the dough, using one sharp tap and not twisting the dough as you cut. Twisting the scone mix will result in an uneven rising. Once cut, the scones can be either brushed with the beaten egg for a shiny glaze, or dusted with flour for a matt finish. Place the scones on the baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown.  For the strawberry compôte, place the strawberries, sugar and 60ml\/2fl oz water in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool and thicken. To serve, leave the scones to cool, then split in half and add butter, jam and clotted cream to serve.
