{"recipe_name":"John Dory with courgette shoestring fries","author":"Russell Norman","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the zucchini shoestring fries, add the oil to a deep-fat fryer and heat to 190C (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not over-fill the pan or leave unattended). Meanwhile, slice the courgettes lengthways using a mandoline to create 4mm thick strips. Carefully dredge the courgette strings in the milk and shake around in the seasoned flour to lightly coat.  Lower the cougette fries into the deep-fat fryer and cook for 3 minutes or until light golden-brown. Remove using a slotted spoon and leave to drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with fine salt and keep warm until ready to serve. Meanwhile for the John Dory, drizzle a generous glug of olive oil into a large shallow pan with a lid. Carefully add the John Dory fillets skin-side down with the garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper. Scatter the chopped herbs over the fish and place the pan over a medium heat. When the pan starts to sizzle, add the stock, lemon juice and orange juice and cover with a lid. After no more than 4 minutes, remove the fillets and place on warm plates. Turn the heat up to high, add the peppercorns and boil the juices until the volume of liquid starts to reduce (about 2 minutes). Take off the heat and pour the reduced juices onto the John Dory fillets. Garnish each fillet with a slice of orange, if using, and serve with the courgette fries alongside. To serve, put the John Dory onto a serving plate and the fries on the side.
