(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended.) Place the eggs, flour and water into a bowl and mix together to create a smooth batter. Add the chopped mint and stir well. Dip the apple into the batter mixture and carefully add to the hot oil. Deep-fry the fritters until golden and crisp, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the crème anglaise, place the egg yolks and sugar into a bowl and beat together until light. Add the cornflour and vanilla seeds and mix well. Place the milk into a saucepan and heat to scalding point - do not boil. Add the warmed milk to the egg mixture, then return the milk mixture to the saucepan and place back onto the heat. Simmer the mixture for three minutes, stirring constantly, until it coats the back of a spoon. To serve, place the crème anglaise into a bowl with the apple fritters placed on top. Dust with cinnamon and icing sugar.
