Line a baking tray with baking parchment and lightly grease with butter, ghee or coconut oil. Grate the cauliflower into rice-sized pieces using a hand grater or food processor. Put all the pizza base ingredients in a bowl and mix well with a spoon, or add to the food processor and blend, to form a sticky dough. Using the back of a spoon, spread the dough out onto the greased parchment on the tray, shaping it into a circle 30cm\/12in wide. Bake in the oven for about five minutes, then flip it over and return to the oven for another two minutes. Pull the mozzarella ball apart into small pieces and arrange over the base of the pizza. Slice the tomatoes into 1cm\/½in thick slices and arrange over the pizza. Add the chilli flakes, if desired. Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes more until the mozzarella is melted and bubbling. Sprinkle the basil over the top of the pizza before serving and drizzle with olive oil.
