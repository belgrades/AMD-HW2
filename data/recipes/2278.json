Grease a 20cm\/8in springform cake tin with butter, then line it with a large sheet of rice paper (or greaseproof paper), leaving enough excess to be able to wrap around the top of the cake. Sprinkle the nuts onto a baking tray and roast in the oven for 4-5 minutes, checking regularly, until toasted and golden-brown.  Transfer the toasted nuts to a bowl and add the mixed candied peel or dried fruit, lemon zest, flour, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, grated nutmeg, white pepper and cocoa powder. Mix until well combined.  Heat the sugar, honey and butter in a pan until bubbling, then continue to cook, stirring well, for 4-5 minutes, or until well combined. Pour the melted honey and sugar mixture over the nut mixture and mix quickly until well combined. Spoon into the prepared cake tin immediately, then fold the excess lining over the top of the cake.  Transfer the cake to the oven and cook for 35-40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Set aside to cool before serving. Serve slices of the cake with hot chocolate sauce or fresh cream.
