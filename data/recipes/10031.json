Remove, drain and set aside.   In a frying pan, heat some olive oil and gently fry the garlic and chilli. Add the olives, capers and the blanched vegetables and fry for a further couple of minutes.  Add the sugar and vinegar and cook until slightly caramelised.  Remove from heat and set aside.   Season the salmon fillet on the skin side, place a few thyme sprigs onto the skin and drizzle with a little olive.  In a hot non-stick frying pan, seal the salmon on each side for about 2-3 minutes leaving the middle slightly raw, or cooked to your liking.   For the mussels and clams, discard any mussels or clams that have broken shells and discard any open ones that do not close when given a sharp tap.  Heat a large saucepan and add the oil. Once hot, add the garlic and chilli and cook until softened.  Add the mussels, clams, parsley and wine and season with salt and pepper. Place a lid on top and cook until the mussels and clams have opened up. Discard any that do not open. Drain the shellfish reserving the cooking liquid. Set the shellfish aside and keep warm. Bring the shellfish cooking liquid to a boil then simmer until reduced to a sauce consistency. To serve, arrange the vegetables on serving plates with the salmon on top skin-side up. Place the shellfish around and pour over the reduced cooking liquid. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.
