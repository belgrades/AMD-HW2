Once melted, add the brioche crumbs and garlic and cook for a couple of minutes or until the crumbs are golden-brown and the garlic cooked.  Transfer to a food processor and add the parsley. Blend until the breadcrumbs are bright green. In the meantime, heat a large griddle pan and rub the steak with olive oil. Place on the griddle and cook on both sides for 2-3 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Set aside to rest before serving. For the tomatoes and green salad, preheat the grill to high. Place the halved tomatoes onto a grill tray and drizzle with oil. Put under the grill for a couple of minutes or until cooked. Once cooked, remove from the grill and sprinkle over some of the green crumbs. For the house dressing, add all the ingredients to a blender and pulse until smooth. To make the salad, place the lettuce and avocado in a large bowl. Just before serving, pour the dressing over the salad and mix. To serve, slice the rested steaks and place on serving plates alongside the crumbed tomatoes and green salad. Sprinkle the remaining crumbs over the steaks.
