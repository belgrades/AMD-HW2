Add the chickpeas and purée briefly if you want to keep some 'crunchiness' in the chickpeas; if you want a totally smooth stuffing it does not matter how vigorously you purée them.  Remove from the processor. Add sunflower seeds and season to taste.  You can use the stuffing inside a turkey, bake it in little balls alongside the bird, or use it as a pâté on toast.
