{"recipe_name":"Roast rosemary and lemon-crusted lamb with sautéed vegetables and red pepper sauce","author":"James Tanner","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the lamb, place the lemon flesh, sea salt, chopped rosemary and a little of the olive oil in a food processor or mini-blender and blend until combined. Spread the lemon mixture over the lamb chump. Use the remaining oil to lightly oil a griddle pan and heat the pan over a high heat. Place the lamb onto the pan and griddle for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until just pink in the middle. Transfer the lamb to a plate and leave to rest in a warm place.  For the red pepper sauce, heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the red pepper and garlic and cook gently for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the chicken stock to the pan and simmer for 2-3 minutes, then blend until smooth using a hand blender. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside to keep warm. For the sautéed vegetables, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan, add the fennel, new potatoes and carrot and sauté for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Drizzle a little balsamic vinegar and sprinkle the chives over the vegetables and cook for a further minute. To serve, slice the lamb into three or four pieces, place the sautéed vegetables onto a serving plate, place the lamb on top of the vegetables and pour over the red pepper sauce.
