{"recipe_name":"Crème brûlée with rhubarb","author":"Thandie Newton","programme":"A Taste of My Life","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the rhubarb, place the rhubarb pieces into a shallow baking dish. Squeeze over the orange juice and drizzle with honey. Place into the oven and bake for 25 minutes, occasionally basting the fruit with the cooking juices. Once the rhubarb is tender, spoon equal quantities into the bottom of four small heatproof dishes or ramekins and set aside. For the crème brûlée, place the milk and cream into a pan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil then remove from the heat. Place the sugar and egg yolks into a clean bowl and beat together until light and fluffy. Gradually add the milk and cream mixture stirring well. Strain the custard back into the pan and add the vanilla pod. Stir over a very low heat until the custard thickens, then remove from the heat and remove the vanilla pod (you can rinse and dry it for use in other recipes). Pour equal amounts of the custard over the rhubarb in the ramekins and leave to go completely cold. Two or three hours before serving, sprinkle the top of each crème brûlée with the demerara sugar or icing sugar so they are each evenly and completely covered with a layer of sugar. Place the dishes under a hot grill or heat with a cook's blowtorch until golden-brown and melted. Allow the tops to cool, then place in the fridge to chill until ready to serve.
