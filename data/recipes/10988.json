{"recipe_name":"Warm raspberry compôte with caramel swirl and whipped cream","author":"James Martin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"To make the compote, put all the compote ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer gently for 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. To make the caramel swirl, place the sugar in a very clean heavy-based saucepan and pour over the warm water. Brush the sides of the saucepan with a pastry brush dipped in water to rinse away any sugar crystals that may have stuck to the sides. Heat over a low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until all the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat and boil until the sugar turns to golden caramel. Dip the base of the pan momentarily in cold water to halt the cooking process, then leave the caramel to stand for a few minutes to allow the caramel to become viscous. Pour a thin line of caramel in a swirl onto oiled baking paper and leave to cool. To serve, pour the compote into a glass, spoon the whipped cream on top, sprinkle over the fresh raspberries and garnish with the caramel swirl and mint sprig. Serve the warmed shortbread biscuits on the side.
