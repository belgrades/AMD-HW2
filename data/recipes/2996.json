Cover and set aside for 3 hours for the vegetable juices to release and exchange flavours.  In a large sauté pan or frying pan over a high heat, sweeten the turnips and swede in the duck fat. Lower the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The vegetables should be slightly soft but still have a little bite. Stir in the vinegar and gin, taste and season if required.  Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks.
