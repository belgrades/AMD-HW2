Brush the sheet of puff pastry with the beaten egg. Remove the sausages from their skins and spread the sausagemeat thinly over the pastry sheet. Cut the stuffing into thin slices and scatter on top. Brush the edges of the pastry with egg, then roll up tightly. Trim off the ends and then cut into thin slices, pressing down to flatten them slightly. Place the palmiers on the preheated baking sheet and bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through and the pastry is lightly golden. Place the cranberry sauce into a small pan and heat gently. To serve, arrange the sausage palmiers on a plate and top with dollops of the hot cranberry sauce.
