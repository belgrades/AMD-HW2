{"recipe_name":"Kadaifi-wrapped king prawns with pine nut tarator","author":"Silvena Rowe","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the tarator, place the bread into a bowl, add enough cold water to cover the bread, then squeeze out the excess water.  Blend the soaked bread, pine nuts, garlic, parsley and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth and well combined.  Gradually add the olive oil and blend to a purée. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and chill in the fridge until needed. For the prawns, in a bowl, mix together the prawns, lemon juice, chopped garlic, coriander and Tabasco until well combined. Chill in the fridge for two hours to marinate. Heat a deep fat fryer to 170C\/325F\/Gas 3, or until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Cut the kadaifi pastry into 12 equal pieces about 10cm\/4in. Place a piece of kadaifi pastry onto a clean work surface. (Keep the remaining pastry pieces covered to prevent them drying out.) Place two basil leaves on top of the pastry.  Place a king prawn at one end of the pastry, then roll the pastry around the prawn until the prawn is covered in pastry.  Repeat the process with the remaining prawns. Carefully lower the wrapped prawns into the hot oil in batches. Fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown. Remove the wrapped prawns from the oil using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Keep warm.  To serve, divide the tarator among four serving plates and arrange three prawns on top of each serving.
