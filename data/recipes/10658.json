Lay a large piece of aluminium foil on a baking sheet and place the carrots on top, fold the foil over to make a parcel and place in the oven for 1½ hours, or until the carrots are tender.  Once cooked, set aside to cool. Then cut the carrots lengthways and place in a shallow container. Place the remaining vinaigrette ingredients in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Pour over the carrots and set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes. For the turbot steaks with cream, baked carrots, orange and wild sorrel, add a little butter to an ovenproof frying pan set over a medium heat. Add the shallots and mushrooms and place the turbot steaks on top. Pour in the wine and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover loosely with a buttered piece of baking parchment and place in the oven for 8-10 minutes. Turn the fish over half way through cooking. Once cooked, remove the fish from the pan and keep warm until ready to serve. Place the frying pan over a medium heat and add the cream and sorrel. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pass the sauce through a sieve and discard the vegetables. To serve, fill a large pan with boiling water and plunge the spinach into the water then drain. Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add the butter, once hot add the spinach and cook for two minutes. Put the wilted spinach in the centre of serving plates and place the turbot on top.
