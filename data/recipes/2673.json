(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Slice the salmon into four long strips. Dip the salmon strips in the beaten egg. Sprinkle the couscous onto a plate and coat the salmon slices in the couscous. Carefully place the salmon into the hot oil and deep fry for about 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and cooked through. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the tomato salsa, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic, tomatoes and chilli flakes and simmer for 2-3 minutes.
