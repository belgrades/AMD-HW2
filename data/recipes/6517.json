For the parmesan scones, place all of the scone ingredients, apart from the milk and cranberries, into a bowl. Work the ingredients together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.  Add the dried cranberries and the milk, a bit at a time (you may not need all of the milk). Using floured hands, knead the mixture into dough and place on a floured work surface. Roll out to a thickness of about 1cm\/½in. Using a cutter, cut into 5cm\/2in rounds and place on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Brush with a little milk (you can also use beaten egg). Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool To serve, spread a thin layer of mascarpone on the top of each scone and top with a small basil leaf. Using a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle, pipe a swirl of mascarpone on top of the basil leaf. Decorate with a cranberry.
