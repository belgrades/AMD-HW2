Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 220C\/425F\/Gas 7.  Pour the juice into the ovenproof dish, then add the rice. Prepare the blackcurrants by pinching out any woody stalks before adding them to the ovenproof dish.  Add the sugar and the vanilla extract. Give the mixture a stir and put on the lid. Place on a baking tray.   You’ll need to ask a grown-up to help with this part. Cook for 20 minutes then leave to stand for at least 10 minutes with the lid on (the rice will carry on cooking). When the rice has cooled a bit, you can eat it!
