Put the tamarind pulp, stock, dates, garam masala, chilli powder and curry powder in a large pan and cook for 20-30 minutes to make tamarind stock. Heat a wok and add the paste. Once hot, add 200ml\/7fl oz of the tamarind stock and the coconut milk. Cook for 4-6 minutes. Drop the cooked lobster pieces in the curry mixture and cook for 1-2 minutes. For the ginger chutney, heat two tablespoons of oil in a frying pan. Fry the cumin seeds for 1-2 minutes then add the sesame seeds, ginger, green chilli and chilli powder and season with a little salt.  Stir for 2-3 minutes and then cover the mixture with a circle of greaseproof paper and let it cook slowly for 40-45 minutes until the ginger is almost cooked.  Let the mixture cool then transfer to a food processor and blend to a fine paste with the tamarind paste and palm sugar.  Heat the remaining oil in a separate pan, add the asafoetida, red chilli and mustard seeds. As the mustard seeds pop, add the curry leaves, stir for 30 seconds then pour into the ginger chutney mixture and mix well. Set aside. For the coconut sticky rice, wash the rice 3 times and drain. Put the rice in a saucepan, cover with coconut milk and water so the liquid is 2cm\/1in above the level of the rice. Add the salt and cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then without opening the lid, turn the heat off and leave to steam for 20 minutes. To serve, pour or spoon the curry and lobster back into the shell (if using) and place on the serving plate. Put a spoon of ginger chutney alongside. Serve the coconut sticky rice in a separate serving bowl. Garnish with chopped fresh coriander.
