{"recipe_name":"Stir-fried prawns in an aromatic tomato cream sauce","author":"Madhur Jaffrey","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4-5","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Put the tomato purée in a bowl.  Add the salt, sugar, garam masala, ground roasted cumin seeds, chilli powder, green coriander, green chilli, lemon juice, and 1 tbsp water.  Mix well.  Slowly add the coconut milk or cream, mixing as you go.  Set aside. Stir-fry the prawns: put the oil in a wok or frying pan and set over highish heat.   When hot, put in the mustard seeds.  As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop - this takes just a few seconds - put in the garlic and curry leaves.   Stir until the garlic turns medium brown and put in the prawns.  Stir until the prawns turn opaque most of the way through and put in the sauce. Turn the heat to medium and just heat the sauce through until it begins to simmer.  By then the prawns should be completely opaque and cooked through.   Turn off the heat.
