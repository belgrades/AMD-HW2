Shape the crab mixture into thick patties using wet hands. Lay on a plate and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to firm up.  Place the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs into three separate wide shallow bowls. Once the crab cakes have rested, dredge them in the flour, then dip them in the egg and finally coat in the panko crumbs. Return them to the plate to rest in the fridge until you are ready to serve. Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the salsa, heat a griddle pan and place the corn on the griddle for 8-10 minutes, turning around until charred all over.  Set aside. Once the corn is cooked, remove it from the griddle and set aside to cool. When the corn is cool enough to handle, remove the kernels using a sharp knife and add to a medium bowl. Add the rest of the salsa ingredients and mix. Set aside. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the crab cakes and cook on each side for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Place onto a baking tray in the oven for five minutes. To serve place the salsa in the centre of the plate and put two crab cakes on top. Top with a wedge of lime.
