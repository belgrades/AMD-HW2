Place the butter and all the dry ingredients for the scones in a food processor and blitz until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. With the motor running, add the egg and enough milk to make a soft but not sticky dough. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and add the raisins.  Knead briefly to work the raisins into the dough. Roll out the dough and, using a floured cutter, cut out six discs. Place the scones on a lightly floured baking tray and bake for 12 minutes or until cooked through. Cool slightly on a wire rack. Stir the vanilla seeds through the whipped cream and chill until required.  Serve with the raisin scones.
