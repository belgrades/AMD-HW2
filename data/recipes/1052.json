{"recipe_name":"Braised pork cheeks with ginger carrots and Jersey Royal potatoes","author":"Bryn Williams","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pork cheeks, season the pork cheeks with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Heat a deep frying pan until hot, add half of the oil and the cheeks and fry on both sides until golden-brown. Remove the cheeks from the pan and set aside. Add the other tablespoon of oil to the pan, then add the onion, carrot, ginger, thyme and coriander seeds and cook over a medium heat until golden-brown. Pour in the ginger beer and cook until the liquid has reduced to a syrupy glaze; then lay the cheeks on top of the vegetables. Pour over the chicken stock to cover, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for one hour until the cheeks are tender. Remove the cheeks from the pan and set aside. Pass the braising liquid through a sieve into a clean pan and return to the heat. Simmer until thickened, then add the cheeks and mix to cover the cheeks in the glaze. For the ginger carrots, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the carrots and cook for two minutes, or until just tender. Drain and set aside. Heat a frying pan until hot, add the ground ginger and honey and bring to the boil. Whisk in the butter, add the cooked carrots and fry for one minute, or until golden-brown. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the Jersey Royals and cook for 4-7 minutes, or until tender. Drain the potatoes, return to the pan and add the butter. Stir to coat. To serve, share the glazed cheeks among four plates, place the carrots alongside and pour any remaining sauce around the pork. Place the Jersey Royals on the side.
