Place in large pan of cold water with the meat trimmings and bring to the boil.  Cook for about 2 hours. When cooked, strain off the stock and set the stock aside. Mince the lungs, heart and trimmings. Put the minced mixture in a bowl and add the finely chopped onions, oatmeal and seasoning.  Mix well and add enough stock to moisten the mixture.  It should have a soft crumbly consistency. Spoon the mixture into the sheep's stomach, so it's just over half full.  Sew up the stomach with strong thread and prick a couple of times so it doesn't explode while cooking. Put the haggis in a pan of boiling water (enough to cover it) and cook for 3  hours without a lid.  Keep adding more water to keep it covered. To serve, cut open the haggis and spoon out the filling.  Serve with neeps (mashed swede or turnip) and tatties (mashed potatoes).
