{"recipe_name":"Chicken, halloumi and green chilli spring roll with carrot and raisin yoghurt salad","author":"Silvena Rowe","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the spring rolls, preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Heat an ovenproof frying pan until hot, add the olive oil and chicken and lightly brown the chicken. Add the cumin, mint, bay leaf and shallots and fry for for 1-2 minutes. Add the stock, bring to a simmer, then cover with a lid and place in the oven to cook for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken and place to one side until it is cool enough to handle. Set aside the stock, then pull the meat off the chicken and shred it into a bowl, discarding the skin and bones. Add the shallots and stock from the chicken, along with the parsley, the crumbled cheese and green chillies to the chicken, and give it a good mix.  Heat a deep fat fryer to 180C\/350F or turn the oven up to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. (CAUTION: Do not leave hot fat unattended.) Place a filo sheet on a clean work surface.   Spoon some chicken filling onto one end of the filo sheet, pull the bottom over and roll up.  Close in the sides, brush with melted butter and seal. Sprinkle with the sesame or hemp seeds. Repeat to use up all the filling and filo. Arrange the rolls onto a tray and bake for 5-6 minutes, or until golden (or place in a deep fat fryer and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and hot through). For the carrot and raisin yoghurt salad, heat a frying pan until hot, add the olive oil and carrot and fry for two minutes over a medium heat. The carrot should be wilted, but not brown. Remove and place into a bowl to cool. Once the carrot has cooled, add the yoghurt, mayonnaise, raisins, garlic and cumin.  Stir well to combine and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle with the chives and serve. To serve, pile the spring rolls onto a plate and spoon the salad alongside.
