{"recipe_name":"Chilli-fried tofu with egg-fried rice","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the tofu, pour the vegetable oil into a deep heavy-based frying pan until it is 3cm\/1in in depth. Heat over a medium heat. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Meanwhile, mix the tofu with the two remaining tablespoons of vegetable oil. Mix the flour and crushed peppercorns together in a bowl. Dredge the tofu in the flour, shake off any excess, then carefully lower the coated tofu into the hot oil and cook the tofu for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. (You may need to do this in batches.) Fry the cashew nuts in the hot oil for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. For the chilli sauce, heat the vinegar, sugar and soy sauce in a non-reactive frying pan until the mixture comes to the boil. Add the chillies, chilli flakes and ginger and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the volume of the liquid had reduced. Add the fried tofu, fried cashew nuts and carrots to the pan, stir well and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the carrots have softened. For the egg-fried rice, heat the oil in a wok over a high heat, add the rice and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the rice is completely warmed through. Whisk the eggs and sesame oil together in a bowl and add to the wok. Stir-fry for a further 2-3 minutes, or until the eggs have cooked through completely. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper then stir through the spring onions and coriander. To serve, spoon the egg-fried rice onto four serving plates and top with a spoonful of chilli-fried tofu.
