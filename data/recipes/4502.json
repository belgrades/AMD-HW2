Measure 15g of salt per 1kg meat and sprinkle the salt with fresh thyme over the legs.  Store in a fridge for at least 12 hours.  Melt duck fat (available tinned from delis) in a pan over a low heat and bring to a simmer.  Place the chilled duck legs in the fat and cook very gently for 1Â½-2 hours, do not boil.  Take off the heat and leave to cool in the fat. Heat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Scrape the fat from the legs and place in a roasting pan.  (Reserve the fat - it's good for roast potatoes or frying eggs). Whisk together the honey and oil and smear over the duck legs.  Sprinkle over the thyme leaves.  Roast the legs in the oven for about 20 minutes, spooning the honey glaze over the legs 2-3 times.  Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in a pan of lightly salted water for about 15 minutes or until just tender.  Drain, then mash with a fork, gradually beating in the hot milk, butter and plenty of seasoning. Place the wine and stock into the saucepan, bring to the boil and continue boiling until reduced by two thirds. Season well. Spoon the mashed potato onto the centre of warm serving plates, sprinkle the seaweed around the mash and sit the duck legs on top.  Scrape any meaty bits from the roasting pan and sprinkle over, then pour over the reduced red wine sauce and serve immediately.
