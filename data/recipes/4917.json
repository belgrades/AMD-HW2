Form into sausage shapes. If you have the time, leave them to rest in the fridge for half an hour. Heat a flat griddle pan. Oil the koftas and cook on the griddle pan and cook for 5–6 minutes. Keep turning until cooked through. For the brown sauce, place all the ingredients, except for the tarragon, into a large wide pan and add enough water to cover the ingredients. Cook for about an hour and a half until reduced to a think consistency. Remove from the heat and blend until smooth. Finish with the fresh tarragon. For the cucumber and mint salad, place all the ingredients into a large bowl and mix. Serve the lamb koftas with flatbreads, the brown sauce and the salad.
