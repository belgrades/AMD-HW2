Lightly butter a baking tray. Place the flour and butter in a large mixing bowl. Add a pinch of salt. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the ground almonds and sugar. In a bowl, mix together the milk, egg and yoghurt. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in two-thirds of the wet ingredients. If it's too dry, add the rest of the wet ingredients to get the desired consistency. Quickly bring together the ingredients to form a soft dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out to form a rough circular shape about 2.5cm\/1in thick. Cut into wedges and place onto the prepared baking tray (use some flour to stop the knife from sticking, if necessary). Sprinkle the scones with flour. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes until the scones are risen and golden. Serve with a bowl of thick clotted cream and ripe strawberries.
