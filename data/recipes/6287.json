{"recipe_name":"Pan-roasted guinea fowl with truffles and leeks","author":"Daniel Galmiche","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":null,"pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Slit the skin of the guinea fowl breasts and place three thin slices of truffle underneath. Fold the skin back over the breast and season both sides with salt and pepper.  Cut the remaining truffle slices into thin julienne strips and set aside. Heat two tablespoons of the oil in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the guinea fowl, skin-side down, and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin is golden-brown. Make sure the pan is not too hot so that the skin does not shrink back too much.  Turn the guinea fowl over and cook for a further minute, then place in the oven for eight minutes. When cooked, remove the guinea fowl from the oven. Set aside and keep warm. While the guinea fowl is in the oven, heat two pans of salted water until boiling, drop the leeks in one and cook for one minute. Drain, refresh in ice-cold water and drain once more.  Put the potatoes into the other pan of boiling water, cook for six minutes, then add the pancetta and cook for a further two minutes. Drain, refresh in ice-cold water and drain again.  Heat a frying pan over a medium heat, add the remaining olive oil, potatoes and pancetta and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden-brown. Add the leeks, a pinch of the reserved truffle and the chervil (or parsley) to the frying pan. Drain off any fat. Add 2-3 tablespoons of water and stir to make a sauce.  Add the butter and the remaining truffle and cook until the butter has melted.  To serve, cut each breast in half lengthways. Place some of the leek and potato mixture in the middle of each serving plate, put the guinea fowl on top and pour the truffle butter sauce over.
