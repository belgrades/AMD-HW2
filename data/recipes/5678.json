Wash the potatoes and pat them dry. Prick the skins with a fork and put the potatoes on a baking tray. Brush them all over with oil. Bake the potatoes until they are soft. Medium-sized potatoes take about an hour.  Cool enough to handle? Then cut off the tops and carefully scoop out the soft potato centres. You can throw away the lids (or eat them). Mash the soft centres with the butter, milk and cheese. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, then pop the mixture back into the potato jackets. Sprinkle with cheese and cook your potatoes under the grill for a few minutes until they are golden. Make a nose and whiskers with half a cherry tomato held in place with a cocktail stick and chives tucked behind. Finish decorating with raisin eyes, radish ears and spring onion tails.
