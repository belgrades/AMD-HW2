For the honey-glazed confit duck, put the salt, thyme, rosemary and garlic into a bowl and mix. Add the duck legs, cover with the mixture and marinate in the fridge for 24 hours. Rinse the duck legs to wash off the salt mixture. Place in an ovenproof lidded saucepan or casserole and add the duck fat and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Cover with the lid and transfer to the oven for 2½ hours. For the spiced lentils, add the butter and oil to a frying pan. Once hot, add the bacon lardons and cook until golden-brown and crisp. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, carrot, celery and spices and cook for a further 2 minutes. Stir in the lentils and red wine and bring to the boil, cook until the wine has reduced in volume by half, then add the stock and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Finish with the sherry vinegar and fresh coriander. For the mashed potato, place the potatoes in a large pan of salted water and bring to the boil, cook for 15-20 minutes or until tender. Drain the potatoes then mash well or pass through a potato ricer. Stir in the milk, cream and butter and mix until smooth. To serve, heat a frying pan and add the butter. Once hot, add the drained duck legs and colour on both sides. Add the honey to the pan and glaze the duck with the pan juices.  Put a spoonful of lentils on each serving plate and place a duck leg on top. Serve the mashed potato alongside. Finish with the warm jus or reduced stock.
