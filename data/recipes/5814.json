{"recipe_name":"Monkfish, chorizo and chickpea salad with balsamic, tomato and lemon dressing","author":"Richard Phillips","programme":"Chefs: Put Your Menu Where Your Mouth Is","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Place the monkfish in a bowl and add the olive oil, saffron and paprika. Mix them together, cover in cling film and place in the fridge for two hours, but no longer, as the acidity will start to cook the fish.  Heat a large frying pan and add the chorizo. Once the oil has been released and it has started to crisp up, pour some of the oil from the pan into a bowl and set aside. Add the chickpeas to the frying pan and cook for a further 4-5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the aged balsamic and green olives, and set aside. Place the tomatoes, red onion and shrimps in a bowl and mix.  Add the lemon juice to the chorizo oil, season with salt and pepper, and set aside. Heat a large frying pan, add the monkfish and seal all over, then cook for 5-8 minutes (depending on the size of the loin). Remove from the heat and set aside to rest for five minutes. To serve, add a couple of tablespoons of the chorizo dressing and chives to the shrimp salad and dot it around the plates. Put a spoonful of the chorizo and chickpea salad in a line in the centre of the plates. Slice the monkfish on an angle and place on top of the chickpeas. Top with some frisée lettuce and drizzle more dressing over the top.
