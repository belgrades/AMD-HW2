{"recipe_name":"Trinidad and Tobago chicken wings","author":"Ed Baines","programme":null,"prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"To prepare the marinade, warm one tablespoon of the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the chilli and garlic and fry gently over a low heat. Add the curry powder, fresh thyme, lemon juice, lemon slices and the sweet chilli. Stir over a low heat for 2-3 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to cool. Place the chicken into a large dish or bowl and pour over the marinade. Mix well to coat the chicken thoroughly and place into the fridge to marinate for at least two hours, preferably overnight. To cook the chicken wings, preheat the oven to 190C\/385F\/Gas 5. Dredge the marinated chicken wings in a bowl of the flour and dust off the excess. Dip the chicken wings into the marinade. Cover a baking sheet with greaseproof paper and grease with olive oil to stop the wings sticking. Place the chicken wings onto the greaseproof paper and transfer to the oven to roast for 25 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven when cooked and place the wings into a serving bowl. Drizzle the lime juice over the wings and drizzle over the remaining sweet chilli. Serve with lime wedges.
