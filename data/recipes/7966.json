Heat the vegetable oil in an ovenproof pan, or a roasting tin. When hot, brown the pheasant on all sides.  Add the Marsala to the pan then roast for 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes.  Pour the roasting juices into a bowl, skim off any excess fat, and reserve. Remove the pancetta and reserve.  Remove the breasts and legs from the pheasant. Peel off the skin and cut around the leg bones to remove as much meat as possible. Tear the meat into pieces and add them to the reserved juices. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Put the radicchio and dandelion leaves into a large bowl. Mix the balsamic vinegar and olive oil to make a dressing. Season with salt and pepper.  Toss the salad with the dressing and place on a large serving plate.  Scatter over the pieces of pheasant with the juice. Scoop out the insides of the chestnuts and place them on top.
