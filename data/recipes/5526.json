Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of a 5cm\/2.5cm chefs' ring on a plate. Place the cream, icing sugar, Greek yoghurt and marmalade in a bowl and mix together well. Spoon the cream mixture into the chefs' ring to cover the ginger crumbs. Heat the outside of the chefs' ring with a mini-blowtorch and carefully release the cheesecake. For the meringue topping, place the sugar and egg whites in a bowl and whisk until stiff and shiny. Spoon the egg mixture into a piping bag and then pipe swirls of egg mixture onto the top of the cheesecake to cover. Lightly brown the meringue topping with a mini-blowtorch and serve, dusted with icing sugar.
