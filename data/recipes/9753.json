Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 6-7 minutes, or until the soufflé is set and golden-brown. For the pesto, place the basil, parsley and oil into a small food processor and blend until smooth, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the spinach, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the spinach and cook for 2-3 minutes until wilted. To serve, place the spinach onto a plate with the soufflé on top and the pesto drizzled over.
