Place the mackerel skin-side up on a baking sheet and place under the grill for 4-5 minutes, or until just cooked through. Set aside to keep warm. For the new potatoes, place the new potatoes in a saucepan of boiling water and boil until tender. Drain, return to the pan and drizzle over the olive oil. Stir to coat the potatoes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the salad, place the salad leaves into a bowl, drizzle over the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir well to dress the salad.
