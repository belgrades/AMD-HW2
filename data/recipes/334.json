With the motor running, add the beaten egg and blend until the mixture starts to come together in a ball. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten slightly. Roll the pastry out on a floured work surface, and using a 7.5cm\/3in cutter, cut out 12 rounds.  Use them to line a 12 hole muffin tin.  Prick the base of the pastry with a fork, and freeze for one hour.  Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Bake the pastry cases for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked through. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.  For the bacon and egg filling, heat the oil in a small non-stick frying pan and fry the bacon over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes on each side until crisp.   Drain on kitchen paper. Mash the hens’ eggs with the mayonnaise, adding salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture into the pastry cases. Cut the quails’ eggs in half and place on top.  Add a strip of bacon to each one and garnish the canapés with rocket leaves.
