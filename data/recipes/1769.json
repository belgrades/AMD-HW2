Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside on a plate.  Add the onions, garlic and ginger to the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the spices and cook for one minute, then return the chicken to the pan and stir until the chicken is coated in the spice mixture. Add the preserved lemons, honey and stock and bring the mixture to the boil. Reduce the heat until simmering, cover with a lid and cook for 45 minutes. Add the dates and stir well, then continue to cook, uncovered, for another 30-45 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir in the parsley. For the herby tabbouleh, drain the bulgur wheat and place into a large bowl. Add the other ingredients and stir until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, spoon the tabbouleh onto serving plates and spoon some tagine alongside.
