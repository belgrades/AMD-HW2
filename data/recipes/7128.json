{"recipe_name":"Pork burgers with spiced apple chutney, leek rings and carrot chips","author":"Tony Tobin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pork burgers, place the mince and oregano into a large bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. Shape into two patties. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the patties for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on all sides and completely cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm. For the spiced apple chutney, place all of the chutney ingredients into a small pan and cook over a low heat for 8-10 minutes, or until the apple has softened and the mixture has thickened. For the leek rings, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dip the leek rings first into the milk, then in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the leek rings into the hot oil. Deep fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the carrot chips, place the carrots into a pan with the butter and orange juice and cook over a medium heat for five minutes. To serve, place the pork burgers onto two serving plates with a dollop of the spiced apple chutney and the carrot chips. Top with the leek rings.
