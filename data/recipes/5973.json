{"recipe_name":"Mustard and lemon sausages with carrot mash","author":"Nigel Slater","programme":"Nigel Slater's Simple Suppers","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/food\/ic\/food_16x9_608\/recipes\/mustard_and_lemon_49577_16x9.jpg","method":"Set the oven at  200C\/400F\/Gas 6.  Put the sausages in a roasting tin large enough to take them in a single layer. If they overlap, they wonâ€™t cook properly.  In a bowl mix the mustards, honey and lemon juice. Stir well and pour over all the sausages. Bake for 25-30 minutes, rolling the sausages over in the honey and mustard mixture once or twice during cooking, so that they eventually take on a sticky, glossy coat.  Meanwhile, to make the mash, trim and scrub the carrots, slice into chunks and pile into a steamer basket or metal colander balanced over a pan of simmering water. Steam, covered, for 15-20 minutes or until just tender.   Remove the carrots from the steamer and mash with a generous knob of butter. Divide the mash between 4 plates and pop the sausages on top.
