Add the prawns and work the marinade into them using your hands. Cover the bowl with cling film and allow to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Heat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and drizzle in a little vegetable oil. Drain any excess marinade from the prawns then fry them quickly on both sides until they are cooked through and slightly charred. (Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the prawns – if using standard supermarket prawns you won't need to cook them for more than 1 minute or so on each side, but if you are using larger prawns you may need to reduce the heat slightly and allow them to cook for a little longer.) The marinade is sticky and sweet which means it will blacken, so don’t panic if the prawns look a little charred. Serve sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, coriander and sliced spring onions.
