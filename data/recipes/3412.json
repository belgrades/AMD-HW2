Add the salt. Bring to the boil, then cover and reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the grains are tender but still have a little bite. Meanwhile, coarsely grate the carrots (use the thick grating blade of a food processor if you have one) and thinly slice the spring onions. Tip into a bowl and add half of the chopped coriander. For the dressing, make the dressing by mixing all the ingredients together in a jam jar and shake. Drain the rice if necessary and add to the bowl with the vegetables.
