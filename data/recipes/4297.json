Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. With floured hands, mould small amounts of the mixture into 7.5cm\/3in long cylinders. Dredge the croquettes in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg and finally dip into the polenta to coat completely. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the croquettes and fry, turning occasionally, until crisp and golden-brown all over. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper. For the sauce, melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat, then add the flour. Cook, stirring well, for 2-3 minutes. Add the milk, a little at a time, stirring constantly. Keep adding the milk and cooking until you have a smooth sauce. Add the parsley and lemon juice, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, place a few croquettes onto each plate and drizzle with the sauce.
