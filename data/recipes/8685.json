Add the garlic and cook for one minute. Add the rice and stir well to coat all the grains of rice in the butter. Add the wine, turn up the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until most of the wine has been absorbed. Add the stock one ladleful at a time, stirring continuously between each addition until all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked. Add the olives, capers and parmesan and stir well. Meanwhile, for the seafood, clean the cockles and clams thoroughly under running water. Discard any that do not close when tapped against a work surface. Place the cockles and clams into a pan, add a splash of water and cover with a lid. Cook for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until all the shells have opened. Discard any cockles and clams that have not opened. Add the cockles and clams to the risotto and stir well. To serve, place the risotto into two serving dishes.
