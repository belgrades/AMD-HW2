Roll out the white fondant icing and cut out circles the same size as the biscuits, brush the backs of the circles with a little cooled boiled water and stick them to the biscuits, smoothing down the icing as you stick it on. Roll out the blue icing and cut out more circles, then cut these in half and using a little more water and stick on top of the white icing for the hats. Brush the hats with water in places where you want the sprinkles to stick and then sprinkle!
