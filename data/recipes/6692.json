{"recipe_name":"Pear chutney","author":"James Martin","programme":"Castle in the Country","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Makes approx. 1 litre","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Heat a large saucepan with the oil, add the rosemary, sultanas, raisins and sugar and fry them until the fruit begins to caramelise.  Pour in the vinegar and boil on a high heat for three minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients, bring to the boil, then turn to a simmer and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Because of the fruit, this chutney has a tendency to stick to the bottom of the pan, so stir it well and keep an eye on it. Don't let the pears cook too much; they should keep their shape. Spoon it into clean hot jars, filling them as full as you can, and seal while hot. Store in the fridge.
