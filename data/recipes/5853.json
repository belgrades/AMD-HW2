Rub the spice mixture over both sides of the lamb. Heat a griddle pan until hot and drizzle the olive oil over the lamb.

Return the pan used to cook the lamb over a low heat and and stir in the honey and pomegranate seeds, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until the honey begins to bubble, then remove from the heat. For the couscous 'cake', melt the butter in a small frying pan until foaming. Mix the cooked couscous with the basil, mint and flatleaf parsley. Pack the mixture into the pan and fry over a low heat for 5-7 minutes on each side (turn the 'cake' over carefully), or until golden-brown and crisp. To serve, turn the couscous 'cake' out onto a plate. Thickly slice the lamb and arrange over the couscous. Drizzle the pomegranate and honey sauce around the edges of the plate.
