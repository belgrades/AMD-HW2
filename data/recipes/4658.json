{"recipe_name":"Hugh's wastenot soup","author":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall","programme":"Hugh's War on Waste","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 3-4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Roughly chop the carrot, onion and potato. Cut the tomatoes in half and rub the cut-side on a coarse cheese grater to get the pulp, and leave the skin behind. Heat a little oil or butter in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Fry gently until the onion and carrot start to soften (about 5 minutes). Add the tomatoes and then the potato pieces. Just cover with plain water or stock. Bring to a simmer and keep simmering until the potatoes are tender (about 10 minutes). Next, add the bag of salad and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until wilted. Season with a bit of salt and pepper. Add a good pinch of curry powder if you like. Blend the soup, either in the saucepan using a stick blender, or transfer to a blender. Blend until fairly smooth (some texture is fine) - then return to the pan. Stir the hummus (if using) gently into the soup. Taste and add more salt and pepper if required.  To serve, fry the bread lightly and serve with the soup. Enjoy!
