Remove the veal from the pan and set aside. Keep warm. Add the mushrooms to the same pan used to cook the veal and fry for 5-6 minutes. Return the veal to the pan. Add the brandy, heat briefly, then set light with a match. Let the flames flare up, then die down. Cook for 3-4 mins longer until most of the liquid has evaporated. (CAUTION: Keep the flames away from the eyes and face. Do not leave unattended.) Add the butter and cream, bring to the boil and heat for one minute. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir in the chopped chives. For the cavolo nero, melt the butter and olive oil in a frying pan and add the cavolo nero. Fry for one minute, then pour in the stock, bring the mixture to the boil and boil for 4-5 minutes, or until tender.  To serve, spoon the veal and wild mushrooms onto a serving plate and serve the cavolo nero alongside.
