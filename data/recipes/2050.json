Melt the chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl placed over a pan of barely simmering water - make sure that the water does not touch the base of the bowl. Place a separate heatproof bowl over a second pan of barely simmering water - make sure the water does not touch the base of the bowl. Add the eggs, sugar, soured cream and vanilla seeds to the bowl and whisk constantly for 5-6 minutes, until the mixture is fluffy and has doubled in volume. Add the melted chocolate and butter mixture to the soured cream mixture and stir to combine. Sift the flour, cinnamon and baking powder together into a separate bowl, then fold the mixture into the melted chocolate mixture. Add the chopped chillies and stir gently. Line a large ovenproof dish or deep baking tray with greased kitchen foil and pour the mixture into the dish. Bake in the oven for 50-60 minutes, or until cooked through. For the sauce, place the cream, butter, cocoa powder, caster sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon into a pan over a low heat and stir for 4-5 minutes, until the ingredients are melted and combined as thick sauce. To serve, cut out slices of the fudge pudding and place onto plates. Drizzle with the sauce and serve with strawberries and whipped cream.
