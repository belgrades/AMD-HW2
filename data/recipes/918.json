{"recipe_name":"Blueberry and chilli molasses-glazed belly of pork with whipped feta, yoghurt and cumin salad","author":"Silvena Rowe","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the belly of pork, preheat the oven to 150C\/300F\/Gas 2. Place the pork belly in a deep roasting tin and pour over the chicken stock – it should come about half-way up the pork belly. Scatter over the spices, cover the tin with aluminium foil and cook in the oven for 2-4 hours, or until very tender. Remove from the oven, drain off the liquid and let the meat cool completely. For the blueberry molasses, place the blueberries and water in a food processor or blender and blend to a purée. Place the purée in a saucepan and add the sugar, lemon and chilli flakes. Bring to a boil and simmer for 40-60 minutes, or until the mixture becomes thick and syrupy. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more chilli if you like a little more spice.  Preheat the oven to 240C\/475F\/Gas 9. Remove the thick layer of skin and fat from the pork belly and discard. Place the pork in a clean roasting tin and glaze the top and side of the meat with the blueberry molasses. Place the pork in the oven for 5-6 minutes, or until the top is caramelised and slightly crisp.  For the salad, whip the feta, yoghurt and ground cumin together in a bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper then place in a clean bowl with the salad leaves. Mix well, then sprinkle with the cumin and sesame seeds.  Cut the pork into squares and serve with the salad.
