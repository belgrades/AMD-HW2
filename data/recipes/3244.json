Melt the butter with the spices in a small pan over a low heat, then pour this into a mixing bowl with the sugar and oil and stir well. Beat in the eggs until smooth. Peel the apples and grate them, discarding the core, and stir the apples into the other ingredients, followed by the crystallised ginger, currants and mixed dried fruit. Stir in the flour and baking powder evenly. Three-quarter fill each muffin paper with spoonfuls of the mixture and bake for about 25 minutes, or until a skewer poked in comes out almost clean. Make the syrup by boiling the sugar with the water in a small pan until dissolved, then leave to liquid to cool. Brush it over the warm cupcakes.  When cold, pipe crosses on the cupcakes with the cream cheese frosting before serving.
