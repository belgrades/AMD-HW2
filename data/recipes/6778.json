Slowly whisk in the lemon juice, peppermint and icing sugar to a stiff paste. Tip the peppermint mixture onto a work surface dusted liberally with icing sugar and roll out thinly. Use a 5cm\/2in cutter to cut out circles and place them onto a baking tray. Chill in the fridge for 1-2 hours, or until the mixture has set. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. (Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water.) Dip each peppermint cream into the melted chocolate and set aside on a baking tray. Chill the peppermint creams until set.
