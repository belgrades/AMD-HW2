For the mashed potato, bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Add the potatoes to the pot and cook until tender, this should tabke about 15 minutes. When cooked drain in a colander and leave to drain for a few minutes. Return to the pot and mash with a potato masher until a smooth consistency is achieved. Set aside.  Put the frozen fish on a roasting tin and cook in the oven for about 10-15 minutes until opaque and starting to flake. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin and any bones and flake the fish into large chunks. Mix the fish, mashed potato, parsley and egg together until well combined. (Mix together carefully so as not to break up the fish too much.) Season with salt and pepper. Shape the mixture into 8-12 patties, depending on how large you want them to be and set aside to chill in the fridge for one hour.  Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan and fry the fish cakes until golden brown on each side and heated right through. Serve with tartare sauce and a simple salad.
