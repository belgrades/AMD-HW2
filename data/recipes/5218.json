For the pilaf, heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and gently fry the onion and pepper for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.  Pour in the stock, bring to the boil and add the rice. Stir well, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering, cover the pan with a lid, and simmer, for 10-12 minutes or until the rice is tender. Stir in the peas and shrimps. For the lemon sole, grease a baking tray and a 10cm\/4in metal ring mould with the oil. Place the ring mould onto a baking tray and line it with the sole fillets to create a ring of fish.  Bake in the oven for 3-4 minutes, remove and pack the pilaff into the centre of the ring, then return to the oven to cook through for a further 4-5 minutes. For the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the pepper in the oil for 3-4 minutes. Add the shrimps and warm through, then stir in the yoghurt, dill and parsley. To serve, place the timbale of sole and rice in the middle of a plate. Carefully remove the ring mould. Spoon the sauce around the edge.
