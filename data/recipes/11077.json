Knead well with your hands and knuckles until the dough is elastic, smooth and shiny. Cover with a piece of cling film and leave to rise for 1 hour. Line a baking tin with baking parchment and mould the dough into a sausage and place in the tin. Preheat your oven to 220C\/450F\/Gas 6, then leave the dough to rise for a further 30 minutes to 1 hour. Place the tin in the oven for 35 minutes. Remove from the tin, tap the bottom with your knuckles - if it sounds hollow, it's ready. Cool on a wire rack.
