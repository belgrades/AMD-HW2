Add the milk and whisk to form a loose batter.   Season with the crushed lavender leaves. Melt half the butter in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Spoon in enough batter to coat the base of the pan in a thin layer. Turn the pancake over when the base is golden-brown. When both sides are browned, remover the pancake from the frying pan and transfer to a warm plate.   Repeat until all the batter has been used. For the filling, mix all the filling ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Spoon the mixture into the centre of the cooled pancakes and roll up. Serve at once.
