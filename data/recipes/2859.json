{"recipe_name":"Crisp fried monkfish with chilli tomato salsa and okra","author":"Paul Rankin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the crisp fried monkfish, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) In a bowl, whisk together the self-raising flour and salt with enough chilled water to make a thick batter. Stir in the sesame seeds.  Dust the monkfish strips with a little flour and shake off the excess, then dip into the batter. Carefully place the monkfish into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the salsa, mix together all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl. For the okra, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan, add the okra and fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the sesame oil and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and fry for one minute. To serve, pile the tomato salsa onto a serving plate. Top with the crisp fried monkfish and place the okra on the side. Garnish with chives and serve.
