{"recipe_name":"Chilli polenta-coated chicken with rocket pesto and roast potatoes","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Place the tomatoes, chilli, crushed chillies, red pepper, red onion and garlic into a food processor and blend to a paste. Stir in two tablespoons of olive oil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the paste into a bowl, add the polenta and mix together well. Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of cling film and flatten slightly with a meat mallet or rolling pin, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a frying pan until hot and add one tablespoon of olive oil and the chicken breasts. Cook on each side, until golden-brown, then place onto a baking tray. Spread the polenta mixture over the top of the chicken breasts then transfer to the oven and roast for 12-15 minutes, until the chicken is completely cooked through. (If the polenta topping is still slightly soft, place the chicken under a grill on its highest setting for 2-3 minutes, until crisp and golden-brown.) For the pesto, place the rocket, garlic, pine nuts, lime juice and olive oil into a clean food processor and blend to a fine paste. For the roast potatoes, slice the potatoes lengthways into wedges and place into a bowl with the olive oil, paprika and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss well to coat the potatoes, then place on a baking tray. Transfer to the oven to roast for 20-25 minutes, until cooked through and crisp on the outside. To serve, place each chicken breast onto a warmed plate with a dollop of pesto and a few roast potatoes alongside.
