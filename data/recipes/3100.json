(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the flour onto a plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Coat the courgette strips in the flour, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the courgette strips into the oil and deep fry until golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt. For the hummus, place all the hummus ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, place the courgettes onto a plate with the hummus in a small bowl alongside and garnish with coriander.
