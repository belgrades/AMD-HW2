{"recipe_name":"Brilliant breakfast omelette","author":null,"programme":null,"prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 1-2","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/food\/ic\/food_16x9_608\/recipes\/baileys_breakfast_24338_16x9.jpg","method":"Take your eggs and crack them into a bowl – don’t put them directly into the pan as you need to mix them first! Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the eggs and stir in the milk.  Beat the eggs with a fork, first use the fork to break the yolks of the eggs (this makes beating the eggs easier). Then tip the bowl gently and using a fork in a circular motion beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are combined and the mixture has an even colour. Bring your pan to a high heat and add the butter. Pour in your egg mixture and cook on a high heat for 2 minutes, making sure that the mixture is spread out evenly. Reduce the heat. As the egg begins to set, use a spatula to push the set egg towards the omelette centre, tilting the pan so the runny egg fills the space. Add the tomatoes and most of the cheese and parsley. Arrange the ham on top.  Cook the omelette for another minute, then loosen the edges with a spatula. Slide the omelette from the pan onto a warmed plate, tilting the pan so that the omelette folds nicely on the plate. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and parsley, then serve.
