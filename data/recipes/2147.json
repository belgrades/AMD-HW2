{"recipe_name":"Chocolate cheesecake with white chocolate icing","author":"Lorraine Pascale","programme":"Home Cooking Made Easy","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"no cooking required","serves":"Serves 10","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Mix the crushed biscuits and butter together in a bowl with the back of a wooden spoon until well combined.  Spoon the mixture into a 23cm\/9in springform tin and press down very hard all the way around the base until flat and even. Mix the cream cheese and icing sugar together in a bowl. Meanwhile melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Pour a quarter of the chocolate into a jug, stir in the oil, then set aside and keep warm. (The chocolate can also be reheated in the microwave for 20 seconds if it cools down.) Place a large dollop of the cream cheese mixture into the bowl of remaining chocolate and stir until well combined. Keep adding the mixture, one dollop at a time, and mixing it vigorously until the chocolate mixture becomes smooth and silky and you have added all of the cream cheese. Pour the mixture onto the biscuit base and use the back of a large spoon to smooth the top, pressing down so that no gaps remain. Chill the cheesecake in the fridge for 20 minutes, or until the chocolate top begins to firm. The cheesecake can also be placed into the freezer for 10 minutes to set. Melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water and make sure the jug of milk chocolate is nice and runny.  Remove the cheesecake from the fridge and pour the milk chocolate on top, spreading it out as you go until the top is completely covered. (For a smooth finish, pick up the cheesecake and tilt it back and forth, letting the chocolate run over and cover the cream cheese filling.) Drizzle white chocolate lines across the top about 2cm\/¾in apart. The neatest way to do this is by putting the chocolate into a piping bag fitted with a very small nozzle.  Place the cheesecake so the lines are running towards you, then take a cocktail stick and drag it from left to right, making lines from left to right 2cm\/¾in apart to form a grid. Drag the cocktail stick once again from right to left between the toothpick lines that you have just made. You will need to do this quite quickly so the chocolate lines are still runny. Leave the cheesecake in a cool place to set for about two hours. Run a sharp knife around the inside of the tin and carefully remove the cake. Serve in wedges with a drizzle of single cream.
