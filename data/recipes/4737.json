Grease a small loaf tin with olive oil. Mix the buttermilk, olive oil and beaten egg together in a large bowl until well combined.

Stir the goats’ cheese, basil, parmesan and chilli flakes into the flour mixture until well combined. Add the buttermilk mixture to the cheese mixture and beat together well, beating as quickly as you can. Spoon the cornbread mixture into the prepared loaf tin and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through (a skewer inserted into the centre of the cornbread should come out clean).
