Trim the sea bass by removing the fins with scissors and scoring the flesh in a crisscross pattern.  To make the paste for the sea bass, put all of the ingredients, except the parsley and tomatoes, in a bowl and mix. Rub the paste all over the fish and stuff the cavity of the fish with the parsley. Take 2 large pieces of aluminium foil big enough to wrap each fish with room to spare. Put an equally-sized piece of greaseproof paper on top of each piece of foil, then lightly grease the paper with oil. Divide the tomatoes between the greaseproof paper and put the fish on top. Wrap the greaseproof paper and aluminium foil around the fish like a Cornish pasty, using the foil to seal it. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until cooked through.  To make the tabbouleh, put the bulgur wheat in a saucepan and cover with the chicken stock. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked. Drain and leave to cool. Put the cooled bulgur and the remaining tabbouleh ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Put the tabblouah on a large serving plate, top with the sea bass and serve.
