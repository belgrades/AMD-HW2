(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dredge the Brie pieces in flour, then dip into the beaten egg and finally the breadcrumbs, pressing the breadcrumbs into the cheese to coat completely. Carefully place the Brie into the hot oil and deep fry for about 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the broccoli, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the broccoli, chilli flakes and spring onions and fry for five minutes, or until the broccoli is tender. Add a splash of water and cook for a few seconds more. To serve, place the broccoli onto a serving plate and top with the Brie.
