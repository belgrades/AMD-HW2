For the broth, heat a deep-sided, heavy-based casserole or saucepan over a low heat. Add all of the broth ingredients, then pour in just enough water to cover them and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering, then simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through if the juices run clear when a skewer is inserted into the thickest part and no traces of pink remain.) Remove the cooked chicken from the casserole and transfer to a baking tray. Cover with aluminium foil and keep warm. Strain the broth, collecting the strained liquid in a large jug. Set aside and keep warm. For the tomato sauce, blend the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée and salt to a smooth purée in a food processor. Set aside. For the jollof sauce, heat the oil in a lidded saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.  Add the garlic and chilli powder and continue to fry for a further 4-5 minutes, stirring well. Stir in the tomato sauce and the reserved broth until well combined. Add the rice and stir to coat it in the sauce. Reduce the heat until the mixture is just simmering, cover the pan with a sheet of aluminium foil, then place the lid on top. Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid.  Halfway through cooking the jollof rice, finish the chicken. Remove the foil from the chicken and roast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until browned and sticky.  Serve the jollof rice with the chicken, garnished with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and coriander.
