Place the dough in a bowl, cover with cling film and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Cut the pasta dough in half and pass it through a pasta machine at its widest setting. Repeat this process, decreasing the roller setting down grade by grade with each pass until the dough is thin enough to pass through your cutter.  Add your cutter to the pasta machine and pass the pasta through the machine to make your shape. Dust the pasta with a little semolina. Repeat the process with the remaining dough, then place the shapes onto a plate and chill in the fridge until ready to use. For the classic ragú sauce, heat a large casserole dish and add the oil. Once hot, add the onion and garlic and gently fry for 2-3 minutes.  Add the carrot, celery and basil and cook for a further two minutes. Add the meat and cook until brown. Add the tomato purée cook for a minute, then add the wine. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, then add the tomatoes and cook for a couple of hours with the lid on. For the green salad, place the lettuce leaves in a large bowl. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Pour over the salad leaves and toss to coat. For the pasta, in a large pan of salted boiling water cook the pasta until al dente. To serve, add the sauce to the cooked pasta and toss until all the pasta is coated.
