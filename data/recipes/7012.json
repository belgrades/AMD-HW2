Reduce the heat to a simmer, then add the pears and poach for 20-30 minutes, or until softened, but still firm. (Turn the pears frequently to keep them covered with the wine.) Remove the pears and set aside. Bring the poaching liquid back up to the boil and cook until the liquid is reduced to a syrup. For the chocolate sauce, place the butter, sugar, cream, cocoa powder, water and chocolate into a pan over a low heat and stir until melted and combined. Continue to heat the sauce for 4-5 minutes, until thick and glossy. To serve, place a pear into the centre of each dish of six dishes and pour the chocolate sauce around. Serve with a dollop of crème fraîche. Dust with cinnamon powder.
