Bring gradually to the boil and simmer until the chicken is cooked all the way through - about 30 minutes.  Carefully remove the chicken breasts from the cooking liquid and keep them warm.  Strain the cooking liquid into a clean pan, discarding the cooked vegetables. Reserve about 450ml\/16fl oz of the liquid. Melt the butter in a separate pan and add the flour. Cook until the mixture forms a smooth paste which leaves the sides and base of pan cleanly. Gradually add the reserved cooking liquid to the mixture, a ladle at a time, allowing to boil after each addition before beating well. Stir until the mixture blends smoothly. Pour the white wine into the sauce and reduce the heat to low.  In a small bowl, combine the egg yolk with the double cream. Stir the egg and cream into the sauce.  Add a squeeze of lemon juice and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Cut the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces and stir into the sauce.  Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve at once.
