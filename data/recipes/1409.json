Line 2 large baking trays with baking parchment. Using an electric hand-whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest together in a large bowl until pale and fluffy.  Beat in the flour, almonds and cardamom until the mixture is well combined and comes together to form a stiff dough. Roll the dough into 24 balls and place 12 on each baking tray – make sure you leave space between each one.  Press each cookie with a cookie stamp or the bottom of a glass to flatten and leave decorative indentations in the dough. Bake a tray at a time for 12–14 minutes until the cookies are pale golden brown.  Leave them to cool on the tray for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. They will crisp up as they cool. Store the cookies in an airtight tin and eat within 7 days.
