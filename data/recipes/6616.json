{"recipe_name":"Pea and marjoram risotto with chargrilled baby squid","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Melt the butter in a large pan until foaming, then fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the risotto rice and stir well to coat in the butter. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the rice grains start to turn translucent. Add the wine and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until nearly all of the liquid has evaporated. Add a ladleful of the chicken stock to the pan and stir well. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until nearly all of the stock has been absorbed, then add another ladleful of the stock. Repeat the process until the rice is cooked but still al dente.  Add the peas during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking, then stir in the chopped marjoram, the marscarpone and parmesan. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Keep warm.  Season the squid with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then toss in a bowl with the olive oil to coat. Heat a griddle pan until smoking, then cook the squid for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and just cooked.  Remove the squid from the pan and place into a bowl with the lemon juice and parsley. Mix well.  To serve, spoon the risotto into the centre of four serving plates and top each serving with some of the baby squid.
