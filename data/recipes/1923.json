Remove the chicken from the pan and put into another frying pan with a knob of butter to keep cooking.   Meanwhile, in the previous pan, add the morels, shallots and garlic to the pan with a little butter and sauté for 30 seconds.  Add a splash of white wine and cognac and flame off.   Then add the double cream and reduce the sauce.  You can add some of the soaking juices if it is too thick.   For the mash, place the potato in a pan of cold water and simmer until cooked.
