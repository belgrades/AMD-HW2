Fold in the mascarpone, sugar, flaked almonds and desiccated coconut and place into the fridge to chill. Meanwhile, for the base, combine the base ingredients in a bowl and mix well to break up the almonds slightly. Press into the base of two 10cm\/4in chefs' rings. Remove the cheesecake mixture from the fridge and use to almost fill the chefs' rings, leaving a 1cm\/½in gap at the top. For the mango topping, mix together the mango, honey and chilli in a bowl and spoon on top of the cheesecakes. Level off the tops with a palette knife and chill in the fridge for ten minutes. To serve, remove the cheesecakes from the fridge. Holding the outside of the rings with a hot cloth, place the cheesecakes onto serving plates and slide off the rings.
