Place all the ingredients for the jerk spice mix in a blender and blend until you have a rough paste. Spread the mixture all over the chicken and leave to marinade for at least an hour. Heat a large griddle pan, drizzle a little oil over the chicken and place skin-side down on the griddle. Cook for five minutes, turn over and place in the oven for 40-45 minutes, or until cooked through. For the rice and pea cakes, heat a large pan and add the butter. Add the onion, cook for a couple of minutes and then add the garlic, chilli and thyme and cook for a further minute. Add the rice and stir to coat the rice. Gradually add the stock a little at a time until all the stock has gone and you have a creamy risotto. Finish by adding the fresh peas and parmesan. Allow to go cold and then set aside in the fridge. To make the rice and pea cakes, heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot take a tablespoon of cold risotto and shape into a small cake the size of a fish cake and fry for a couple of minutes each side.   For the slaw, add the egg yolks to a small food processor and add the mustard and vinegar. Start the motor on the processor and gradually add the oil a little at a time to make mayonnaise. Place the sliced celeriac and carrot in a large glass bowl and add the mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard and chives.  To serve carve the chicken into portions and place on a plate with the rice and pea cakes and slaw.
