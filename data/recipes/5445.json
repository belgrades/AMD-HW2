{"recipe_name":"Mango and honey cakes with pear syrup and cream","author":"Lesley Waters","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/360F\/Gas 4. For the cakes, place the butter and sugar into a food processor and blend until light and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, add the honey and flour and blend, then gradually add enough milk to allow the mixture to reach dropping consistency (it will drop off a wooden spoon, but not be too runny). Place tablespoonfuls of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper, leaving enough space between spoonfuls to allow for spread. Press a piece of mango into the top of each portion, then transfer to the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. For the syrup, place the orange and lime juice and the pear wine into a non-reactive pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Cook for 5-7 minutes to reduce the liquid to a syrup. To serve, place the honey mango cakes in a stack on a serving plate with the syrup poured over the top.
