Thread the pork cubes and dates onto a skewer, then place the skewer onto the pan and cook until golden-brown on all sides. 2. Drizzle the soy sauce and honey and sprinkle the sesame seeds over the pork and dates and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Meanwhile, for the couscous salad, place the couscous into a bowl and pour over enough hot vegetable stock to cover the couscous. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave to stand for 4-5 minutes.  Remove the cling film, separate the grains of couscous with a fork, then add all of the remaining ingredients to the bowl and mix well. Lightly oil a 6cm\/2½in chefs' ring or a small glass bowl and place onto a serving plate. Spoon the couscous salad into the ring or bowl, then remove the ring or turn the bowl out onto the plate and carefully lift off. To serve, place the skewer on top of the couscous salad and garnish with chives.
