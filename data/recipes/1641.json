In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, courgette, salt, freshly ground black pepper and cheddar and mix well. In a separate bowl, mix together the milk, egg and olive oil. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well. Grease ten muffin moulds and half-fill each with the mix. Prick each cherry tomato - this stops them popping when they cook - and press one tomato into the top of each spoonful of mix.  Spoon the remaining mixture over each muffin to conceal the tomato. Cook for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
