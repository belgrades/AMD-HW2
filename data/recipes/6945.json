Weigh and measure all the ingredients.  Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 220C\/425F\/Gas 7. Oil the muffin tray using a pastry brush and place it onto a baking tray.   Break the egg into a small bowl and beat it with the fork.  Place the flour into a mixing bowl, add the egg and stir.   Add the milk to the flour mixture and stir again until you have lots of bubbles and all the flour disappears. This mixture is called a batter.   Add the mustard to the batter. Pour the batter from the mixing bowl into the measuring jug that had the milk in it.  Tear up the mushrooms and divide the pieces between the muffin cups.  Ask a grown-up to help you with using the scissors to cut up the bacon into small pieces. Divide these between the muffin cups, too.  Then chop the tomatoes and share them out between the muffin cups. Finally, pour the batter over the top. You’ll need to ask a grown-up for help with this part. Put the muffins into the preheated oven for 15–20 minutes, or until brown on top. Once the popovers have cooled down a little, you can eat them!
