Cook for 5 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and prawns, then turn down the heat and cook for a further 5 minutes. Finish by stirring in the Greek yoghurt and take off the heat. For the griddled aubergine, rub the aubergine slices with oil on both sides and place on a hot griddle pan. Cook for 3 minutes on each side or until soft and charred. Reserve one slice of the griddled aubergine and slice into four for decoration later. With the 3 remaining slices, place a spoonful of the prawn mixture in the middle of each slice and roll to secure. Place the parcels on a plate and decorate with the sliced aubergine.
