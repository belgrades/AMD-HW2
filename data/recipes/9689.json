Set the remaining spring onions aside. Pour the soy sauce and sherry over the spring onions and ginger. Place the fish skin side up on a board and make six small incisions into each. Place the banana leaves into the steamer and place a piece of sea bass on top of each piece of leaf. (If you have a large steamer you should be able to fit 3 in each steamer layer.) Spoon the spring onion mixture over the top. Place the lid on the steamer and set over a saucepan of boiling water. Steam for 6-7 minutes until just cooked through. Meanwhile, heat the groundnut oil in a wok and stir-fry the Chinese greens until tender. Finally, heat a frying pan until hot, and add the sesame oil and heat until just smoking. To serve, place the greens onto a plate, top with the fish, and remaining spring onions, then pour over the hot sesame oil.
