Place the egg whites into a bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form. Place the egg yolks and grated cheese in a separate bowl. Whisk together and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour the warm cream over the egg yolks and cheese and mix together well. Spoon a little of the stiff egg whites into the yolk mixture and mix well. Add the rest of the egg white and gently fold together with a metal spoon, being careful to maintain volume.
