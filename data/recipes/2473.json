Cook for a further three minutes or until tender. Add the choy sum and lime juice and gently simmer for a further two minutes. Pour into a bowl and keep warm. For the crispy noodle cake, heat the oil in a heavy based saucepan, until a breadcrumb sizzles gently.  (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)
