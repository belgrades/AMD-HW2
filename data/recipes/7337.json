For the prawns, thread the prawns onto the wooden skewer, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Heat a griddle pan until smoking, add the prawn skewer and griddle for 2-3 minutes on each side. Squeeze over the lime juice, then remove from the heat. For the crisp noodles, pour the vegetable oil into a saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread dropped in sizzles and turns golden in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Carefully drop the rice noodles into the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until puffed up and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the chilli oil, heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the chilli flakes and cook over a low heat for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse until cool. To serve, place the crisp noodles onto a serving plate, top with the prawn skewer and drizzle over the chilli oil. Garnish with the lime wedges and fresh coriander leaves.
