Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for 20 minutes before straining. Then melt the butter in a non-stick pan, stir in the flour, and cook over a low heat for five minutes.  When smooth, start adding some of the strained milk. Stir until smooth, and then add more milk until the sauce is thickened.  Cook for 10-15 minutes to ensure the flour is cooked through.
