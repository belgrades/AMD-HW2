{"recipe_name":"Ploughman’s loaf","author":"Mary-Anne Boermans","programme":"The Great British Bake Off","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Makes 1 loaf","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Place the rolled oats into a dry frying pan over medium heat and toast until lightly browned. Mix the dry ingredients, including the yeast, in a large bowl then add the beer and stir to combine. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes, using a scraper to lift and turn the dough. Roll the dough in a little of the oil and set it aside in a warm place until it has doubled in size. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onions until caramelised – this will take about 40 minutes. Set the onions aside to cool. When dough has risen, knock it back on a floured work surface and knead in the cooled onions and the cheese. Form the dough into a loaf shape, place it on a greased baking sheet and set aside for one hour to prove again. Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas4. Dust the loaf with a little more flour, cut slashes in the top and bake for 40-50 minutes or until the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
