Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper or baking parchment. For the crumble topping, rub the butter, sugar and flour together in a bowl until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the mixture onto the lined baking tray, then bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. For the sauce, heat the sugar, brandy and wine in a pan until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture resembles syrup. Set aside to cool.  Blend the strawberries to a purée in a food processor. Strain the blended strawberries through a sieve, then fold the strained purée into the syrup until combined.  For the coconut cream, whisk the double cream and icing sugar in a large bowl until slightly thickened.  Add the coconut milk and continue to whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Whisk in additional icing sugar, to taste, to sweeten the mixture. To serve, arrange a mixture of the blackberries, raspberries and blueberries into the centre of each of six serving dishes. Spoon the sauce on top, followed by the coconut cream. Sprinkle over the cinnamon crumble. Garnish with the redcurrant sprigs and dust with icing sugar.
