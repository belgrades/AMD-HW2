For the chicken, rub the oil into the meat and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a small amount of oil in a griddle pan over a high heat.

Remove the pan from the oven and turn the potato slices over, then return the pan to the oven and cook the potatoes for a further 5-7 minutes, or until cooked through. For the sweet and sour roast tomatoes, press the flat sides of the tomato halves onto a floured work surface so that they are coated with flour.

Sprinkle the tomatoes with the sugar and balsamic vinegar, then place the pan into the oven to roast for 6-8 minutes.
