For the tomato sauce, place all the sauce ingredients into a bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. Spread the sauce evenly over the dough circle, leaving a thin border around the edge. For the topping, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and cook the butternut squash pieces, garlic and thyme for 5-6 minutes, or until just tender.
