Heat a frying pan until hot then add half the butter and all the onions. Sweat for 3-4 minutes until just softened. Place a layer of celeriac slices  into the bottom of a buttered ovenproof dish. Top with a layer of onions, then potatoes, then onions again, seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper as you go. Repeat with the remaining celeriac, onions and potatoes, finishing with a layer of potatoes. Dot with the remaining butter. Pour over the hot stock so all the layers are covered. Transfer to the oven and cook for 45-60 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the stock hasn't completely evaporated, and pressing the layers down with the back of a spoon. Bake until nearly all the stock is absorbed and the top layer is golden brown. Serve.
