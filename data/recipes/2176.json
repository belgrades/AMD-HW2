Mix the milk and yoghurt together, then warm until it reaches body temperature or 37C if using a food thermometer. In a separate bowl, mix the flour with the yeast. Slowly mix the milk mixture into the butter mixture. If it curdles, add a little of the flour mixture, then go back to adding the milk.  Change the attachment on the mixer to a dough hook, then tip the flour on top of the wet ingredients and knead on a low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 10 minutes.  Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to prove in a warm place for 45 minutes.  For the filling, in a food processor combine the chocolate, both kinds of almonds, cocoa powder, chilli and spices. Pulse until it forms the consistency of breadcrumbs. Grease a 30x20x6cm\/12x8x2½in baking tray and line with greased baking parchment. Flour the work surface and tip the dough out onto it. Cut away a third of the dough and set aside. Stretch the remaining dough into a rectangle approximately 40x20cm\/16x8in. Cover the dough with two-thirds of the filling mixture, leaving a 1cm\/½in gap at the long edge closest to you. Tightly roll up the dough starting with the long edge which is farthest away from you. Use the 1cm\/½in strip (that is not covered with filling) to seal the join. Cut the roll into twelve 3cm\/1¼in-thick slices and place on the prepared tray.  Stretch out the remaining dough into a 10x30cm\/4x12in rectangle. Cover with the remaining filling, leaving a 1cm\/½in gap at the long edge closest to you. Cut into six 4cm\/1½in thick slices and use them to fill the gaps between the larger rolls. Place in a warm place to prove for a further 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4. To finish, brush the top of the buns with beaten egg and sprinkle with cocoa nibs. Bake in the middle of the oven for 30-40 minutes. Remove from the baking tray and set aside to cool on a wire rack.
