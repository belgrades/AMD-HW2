Grease the tin with baking spread and line the base with baking paper. Measure all the ingredients into a large bowl and beat for 2 minutes, or until well blended. Turn the mixture into the prepared tin and level the top. Bake for 35â€“40 minutes until the cake has shrunk a little from the sides of the tin and springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip in the centre of the cake.  Meanwhile, make the glaze. Mix the granulated sugar with the lemon juice and stir to a runny consistency.  Leave the cake to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then lift out, with the lining paper still attached, and place on wire rack set over a tray. Brush the glaze all over the surface of the warm cake and leave to set. Remove the lining paper and cut into slices to serve.
