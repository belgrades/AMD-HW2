For the stuffed tomatoes, place the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, chilli flakes and ginger in a pestle and mortar and grind to a powder. Add the ground spices and chilli flakes to a hot frying pan and dry fry for one minute to release their fragrance. Add the oil, garlic, onion and minced beef and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until browned. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the minced beef mixture into the hollow tomato halves, place onto a baking sheet, then place into the oven to bake for eight minutes. For the fried parsnip and potato skins, heat the vegetable oil in a deep, heavy bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when added to it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous, do not leave unattended.) Carefully add the potato and parsnip skins and deep-fry for 3-4 minutes, until golden. Carefully remove and drain on kitchen towels. To serve, place the stuffed tomatoes onto a large plate and arrange the fried parsnip and potato skins around the plate.
