Pour over the white wine and the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Completely cover the salmon with the remaining parsley. Cover with foil and place in the oven.

For the potatoes, heat a saucepan of water and bring to the boil. Add a pinch of salt, then add the potatoes and cook until al dente.
