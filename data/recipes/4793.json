Place the remaining jerk chicken ingredients into a food processor and blend to a purée. Pour the marinade over the chicken and turn to coat all the pieces. Place into the fridge for at least four hours, but preferably overnight. Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat a griddle pan until very hot. Add the chicken pieces and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side, then place onto a baking tray. Spoon the remaining marinade over the chicken and transfer to the oven to cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through.  Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 2-3 minutes before serving.  For the rice, place the rice into a saucepan with 400ml\/14fl oz of cold water. Cover with a lid and place over a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer very gently until all of the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender (about 10-15 minutes). Turn off the heat and leave to steam for 5-6 minutes. Place the rice into a bowl and add all the remaining rice ingredients and mix well to combine. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, spoon a little of the rice onto each plate and top with a piece of jerk chicken. Garnish with a couple of wedges of lime.
