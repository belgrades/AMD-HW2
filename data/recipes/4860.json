Kid’s job: Place all of the grated vegetables in a bowl with the oil and orange juice (or a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice) and stir well so that all of the colours mix together.  Kid’s job: Have a taste -you may like the salad as it is but you can add more orange or lemon juice to taste and also herbs and seeds if you have them. Kid’s job: If you are using them add the mayonnaise or yoghurt a teaspoon at a time, stirring it in well and tasting until you have a flavour that you like. Keep the salad in the fridge. It will keep for up to three days in a sealed plastic tub.
