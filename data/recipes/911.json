Transfer the steaks to the oven and roast for 8-10 minutes (for rare), 12-15 minutes (for medium), or until cooked to your liking. Remove the steaks from the oven and set aside to rest for at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, blend 75g\/3oz of the butter and all of the blue cheese in a food processor until just smooth.
