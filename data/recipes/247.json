Place the duck breast skin-side down into a cold frying pan. Turn on the heat and bring up to a medium heat - this will allow the fat to render. Fry the duck for 10-12 minutes, draining off the fat into a bowl from time to time. Turn the duck breast over. Add the honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, plum and chilli to the pan and simmer until slightly reduced, adding a splash of water if necessary. Cook the duck breast for another 2-4 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. To serve, place the lettuce and potato onto a plate, top with the duck breast and drizzle over the pan juices.
