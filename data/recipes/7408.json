Pour the vinegar and cider over, then scatter over the onion and garlic. Cover with parchment paper, then wrap in foil and place into the oven to roast for three hours. Remove the parchment and foil, then roast for another hour. 'Pull' the pork by sticking a fork in the shoulder and shredding the meat into small pieces with another fork.
