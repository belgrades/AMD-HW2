Pour the milk and cream into a pan, add the vanilla pod and gradually bring to the boil. Place the eggs, egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl and mix well. While the cream is heating, slice the croissants and place in an ovenproof dish, slightly overlapping the pieces. Sprinkle with sultanas and pour over the butter. Once the cream has boiled, take it off the heat. Add the egg mixture and chocolate and stir well. Set on one side to allow the chocolate to melt, stirring occasionally. Add the whisky to the cream mixture. Next, using a sieve, strain the cream over the croissants, cover with foil and bake in the oven for fifteen to twenty minutes or until almost set. Remove from the oven, coat the top with the jam and dust with icing sugar. Caramelize the topping using a very hot grill.  Serve at room temperature with a spoonful of ice cream.
