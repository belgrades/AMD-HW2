Place the cream, yoghurt and icing sugar into a bowl and mix together well.  Spoon the cream mixture into the glass and top with the remaining mango. For the spun sugar, place the sugar and enough water to cover into a saucepan and place over a high heat. Leave until the sugar has dissolved and the liquid has turned a light caramel colour. Remove from the heat and place the saucepan into a frying pan containing cold water.  Using a fork, carefully pull out  sugar threads from the pan and shape around an oiled clean steel or other metal implement in a twisted pattern.  To serve, place the sugar threads on top of the pudding glass along with a sprig of mint.
