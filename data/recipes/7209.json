Season the pork with black pepper. Put an ovenproof casserole dish (with a lid) on the hob. Add the lard and heat to melt it. Add the pork and colour the joint on all sides, then remove it and set it aside. Add the onions and fry gently to colour them lightly, then add the garlic. Put the meat back in the casserole and add the wine and stock. Put the lid on and bring to the boil. Turn down to a simmer and put in the oven. After 30 minutes turn the oven down to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4 and cook for a further 1½ hours, checking occasionally to ensure it hasn't boiled dry. Take out and allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Strain the meat juices through a sieve into a clean pan. For the cabbage, melt the butter in a roasting tray, then add the bacon. Lay the cabbage wedges on top, then add the thyme, bay leaf and stock. Season with pepper, cover with foil and braise in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until tender. Place the cabbage on platter. Strain the residue of the braising liquor through a sieve and add it to the residue of roasting juices. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add the parsley. Carve the meat, lay it on top of the cabbage and pour the sauce over it.
