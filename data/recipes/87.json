Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for at least an hour.  Strain the mixture and return the mulled wine to the bottle - use a funnel to make life easier for yourself. The wine can be kept for around a week.  To serve, pour the wine into a saucepan and heat it. Place a few flaked almonds and raisins in the bottom of your serving cups, and pour the glögg over the mixture.  If you want to give your glögg a kick, add a splash of either vodka, aquavit, rum or cognac just after you’ve reheated the wine.
