(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Meanwhile, make the batter by combining the flour, cornflour and baking powder in a bowl. Whisk in enough beer to make a batter the consistency of single cream.  Dip the prawns into the batter, shaking off any excess, then deep-fry for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper, then serve.
