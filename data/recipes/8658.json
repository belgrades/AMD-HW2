{"recipe_name":"Sea bass with herb gnocchi","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Place the water, butter and salt into a medium saucepan and heat to a simmer.  Reduce the heat, add the flour and stir rapidly until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and the bottom of the pan is clean, with no dough sticking to it. The dough should be glossy and smooth but still moist. Transfer the dough to a food processor, add the eggs and blend until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the herbs and Emmental. Place the dough into a piping bag and allow to rest for 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Take the bag of dough and hold it above the boiling water. Squeeze the back of the bag with your right hand and, holding a knife in your left hand, cut off 2.5cm\/1in lengths of dough, allowing these individual gnocchi to drop into the water.  Pipe about 12 gnocchi per batch. The gnocchi will sink at first; when it floats to the top continue to poach for another 1-2 minutes, then remove them with a slotted spoon and drain onto paper towels. For the sea bass, heat a frying pan until hot, then add the oil and half of the butter. Season the sea bass with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then place the fillets skin-side down into the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes, until crisp and golden-brown. Turn the sea bass fillets and cook for a further 1-2 minutes. Heat another frying pan and when hot add the remaining butter and the shallots. Gently fry the shallots for 3-4 minutes, until soft. Add the white wine and heat to reduce the liquid by half. Add the cream and continue heating to reduce the liquid volume by a third. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add the beans, artichokes and gnocchi and heat through.  Add the parsley and spoon onto a plate and top with the sea bass fillet.
