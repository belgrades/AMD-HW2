Mix well, using a whisk, while slowly pouring in the milk until the mixture becomes a smooth batter, the consistency of double cream - you may not need all the milk. Melt the butter in a frying pan and pour in a ladle of the batter, swirling the pan to coat the surface evenly.  Fry for one minute until golden-brown on one side, then turn over and fry for another minute until golden-brown on both sides. Repeat until you have used up all of the batter. In a bowl, whip the cream together with the icing sugar and brandy until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. To serve, fold the pancake into quarters and drizzle over the melted chocolate. Spoon the whipped brandy cream onto the side and serve.
