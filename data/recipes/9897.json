For the chicken Kiev, using a sharp knife, carefully cut a pocket into the side of the chicken breast. Place the cheddar, butter and chives in a bowl and mix well. Stuff the butter mixture into the pocket cut in the chicken. Lay the streaky bacon on a clean surface arranged in lines overlapping slightly to create a blanket. Place the chicken at one end of the bacon blanket and roll the bacon around the chicken. Heat an ovenproof frying pan over a high heat.
