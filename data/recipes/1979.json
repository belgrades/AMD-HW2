Once the oil is smoking, add the chicken, onions and garlic and fry for 30 seconds over a fierce heat. Immediately add the ginger, chilli powder, turmeric, coriander and cumin and fry for a further minute. Stir in the tomato purée and the chopped tomatoes and boil rapidly for five minutes. Allow to cool slightly. Add the yoghurt and double cream. Return to a low heat, bring to a simmer and then stir in the salt and lime juice. If the curry is too thick at this stage you can add a little water (or chicken stock) to get the correct consistency. Serve the curry with cooked basmati rice and chopped coriander.
