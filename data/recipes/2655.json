Heat a deep fat fryer to 180C\/350F (Caution: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Roll the flowers in flour then dip in the beaten egg coat them. Deep fry the flowers for a couple of minutes until crisp. Carefully remove from the fryer and drain on a plate lined with kitchen roll. For the pea purée, heat a large saucepan of boiling water and season with salt. Blanch the peas and then drain and allow to cool. Place the peas and mint leaves into a blender and blend to make a purée. Season with salt and pepper to taste. To serve, place the pea purée on the plate along with the courgette flowers. Top with the pea shoots and Manchego cheese and drizzle with the mint oil.
