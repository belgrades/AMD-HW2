{"recipe_name":"Stuffed peppers with mushrooms and ricotta cheese","author":"Gino D'Acampo","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Place the peppers in a baking tray and roast them in a pre-heated oven at 180C\/356F\/Gas 4 for approximately 20 minutes.  Place them in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with cling film and allow the peppers to cool. This will loosen the skin, making the peppers easy to peel.  Once cooled, peel off the skin, discard the seeds and cut the pepper in half lengthways.  Place the pepper halves on a chopping board ready to be stuffed. In a frying pan, shallow-fry the oyster and chestnut mushrooms in the olive oil until soft.  Season with salt and pepper and allow to cool.  In a large bowl, mix the ricotta and chopped dried porcini mushrooms with the mustard and then add in the cooked chestnut and oyster mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper.  Mix well. Place two tablespoons of the mushroom mixture on each pepper half. Gently roll and hold in place using a toothpick. Repeat until pepper halves and mix are used up. Once ready, put the rolled peppers on a baking tray, sprinkle with the pecorino cheese and grill for approximately five minutes.  Serve them immediately with some mixed salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice.
