The consistency should be about that of ordinary double cream, but no thinner. Rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 220C\/425F\/Gas 7. Carefully remove the skin from each of the sausages. Wrap each piece of skinned sausage meat in a piece of cured ham. Put the dripping or lard in a roasting tin and leave it in the oven until it is smoking. Pour in the batter - it will sizzle softly in the hot fat - then arrange the sausages in the batter. Transfer the tin back into the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until puffed and golden. Serve with brown onion and madeira gravy.
