{"recipe_name":"Risotto of fresh (wild) mushrooms","author":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall","programme":null,"prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"In a large pan bring the stock almost to the boil and keep hot on a very low flame. In another pan melt the butter and sweat the onion until softened but not brown. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for a few more minutes. Add the rice, stir well and cook until well coated and slightly translucent. Add a ladle of hot stock and let it simmer gently until absorbed by the rice. Add another, and so on, until the rice is cooked (15-20 minutes). As a general rule for risottos, you need four times as much water as rice, by volume. And the rice is done when tender but still just a tiny bit chalky in the middle. Check the seasoning and stir in the olive oil, remaining butter and a couple of spoonfuls of grated parmesan. Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan on the table.
