Drain and refresh under cold water, then crack and peel the egg. Finely chop the cooked egg and leave to one side. Divide the asparagus into four equal-sized bunches and tie each bunch with kitchen string to secure. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil over a medium heat, add the bunched asparagus and simmer for 5-8 minutes (depending on the size of your asparagus) until tender, but with just a little resistance when pierced with the top of a knife.  Grate the zest from the grapefruit, reserve a pinch and put the rest in a small bowl. Peel the grapefruit, then take out four segments, cut each one in half and leave to one side, juice the rest of the grapefruit, pressing it through a fine sieve into the bowl with the zest. Add the mustard and mayonnaise and whisk together until well blended, then whisk in the sunflower oil in a steady stream. Stir in the chopped egg and chervil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the asparagus from the pan and drain briefly on a plate lined with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel. Remove the string and put the asparagus onto four serving plates. Spoon the dressing over the top and finish with the reserved grapefruit segments and a sprinkling of the reserved zest.  Serve with griddled green asparagus and chargrilled bread.
