Allow to cool, peel the skin off and flake the fish into a bowl. Set to one side. In a thick-bottomed pan sweat the chopped onion in half of the olive oil until translucent, pour in the rice and fry until you start to hear it pop. Pour on the white wine and stir continuously until the wine has been absorbed. Have the stocks boiling and at the ready and add to the pan. Stir occasionally and cook for 10-12 minutes. The rice should be suspended in a thick sauce with a little bite. Beat in the butter and the spring onions.  Add the parmesan, beating all the time. Now add the fish and herbs.
