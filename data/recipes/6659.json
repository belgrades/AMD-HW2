{"recipe_name":"Peanut chicken with satay sauce and little gem salad","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Blend the peanuts and breadcrumbs in a food processor to a fine powder, sprinkle onto a plate. Sprinkle the flour onto a separate plate. Dredge the chicken strips in the flour, then dip into the egg and roll in the peanut crumbs. Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 190C\/375F (use a probe thermometer to check the temperature if you're not using a deep-fat fryer). (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Don't leave unattended) Fry the chicken strips for 3-4 minutes until golden-brown. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.  Meanwhile for the satay sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the shallot, chilli, garlic and ginger and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Pour in the coconut milk, lime juice and soy sauce and bring to a simmer. Add the peanuts, then blend the mixture in a food processor to a chunky sauce. Add more soy sauce and lime juice to taste. For the salad, mix the leaves, red onion, radishes and mint together in a bowl until well combined. Whisk the lime juice and vegetable oil in a bowl and mix with the salad until well combined. To serve, place some salad onto the plate, with the chicken strips alongside. Spoon the satay sauce into a small bowl and serve alongside.
