{"recipe_name":"Glazed brisket steaks with broccoli salad","author":"Brian Turner","programme":"A Taste of Britain","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Put the brisket in a large pot with the carrots and onions.  Tie up the parsley stalks, peppercorns and bay leaf in a muslin bag and add to the pot. Cover well with cold water and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat to a low simmer. The water should just be ‘trembling’. Cook, uncovered, for up to three hours, depending on the thickness of the meat. Top up the water as it evaporates to ensure the meat doesn't dry out. To check the meat is cooked, pierce with a roasting fork and lift, the meat should just start to slide off the fork.  Transfer the meat to a large container. Strain the cooking liquor and pour it over the meat, then leave to cool. Pour away the cooking liquor, cover the meat with cling film and then put a tray on top with weights on it to press the meat.  When cold, slice the brisket into nice steak-sized pieces. For the marinade, mix all the ingredients together. To grill the steaks, heat the oil in a ridged griddle pan or preheat a barbecue. Grill the steaks, brushing frequently with the marinade, until hot through. For the dressing, mix together all the ingredients. For the salad, blanch the broccoli in boiling salted water, then drain and refresh in cold water. Separate the outer leaves of the Little Gems, toss them in the dressing and lay them on serving plates, then repeat with the hearts. Toss the broccoli in the dressing and lay on top of the leaves. Place the meat on top and serve.
