{"recipe_name":"Pancakes with feta cheese glazed with cinnamon, honey, orange and saffron","author":"Michel Roux Jr.","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pancakes, combine the flour, sugar and salt, then mix in the eggs using a whisk. Add the milk gradually to avoid any lumps. To cook the pancakes, add a smear of melted butter to a non-stick frying pan, using a pastry brush. Ladle in some batter, swirling around to coat the pan - it might take one or two test pancakes before you’ve got the amount of batter just right. Cook each pancake on both sides until golden-brown and then remove to a plate while you cook the next pancake. For the salad, place the cut lettuce into ice-cold water and leave for a couple of minutes. Just before serving, remove from the water and drizzle with olive oil. For the glaze, heat a medium saucepan and add the orange juice and cinnamon stick. Stir in the honey and saffron and cook until reduced to a syrupy glaze. Sprinkle the feta on the pancakes and fold them into quarters. Return the folded pancakes to the frying pan and pour over the glaze. Heat gently for a few minutes. Serve the pancakes with any remaining glaze poured on top. Serve the salad alongside.
