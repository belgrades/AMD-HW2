Remove the shells from the prawns and set the prawns aside. Place the shells in a small pan and cover with water.  Add the lime leaves and peppercorns, then simmer over a gentle heat for five minutes. For the spice paste, place the garlic, lemongrass, ginger and chilli into a small food processor and blend for a few seconds.  Add the coriander and blend to a rough paste. Strain the prawn stock through a sieve, discard the shells, then return the stock to the pan and keep warm. For the prawns, pour the oil into a large, heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat, then add the spice paste.  Fry gently for two minutes then add 300ml\/½ pint of the stock. Add the coconut milk, a generous pinch of salt, the mangetout and the prawns. Simmer for 3-4 minutes. Divide the beansprouts between two large bowls, then spoon the prawn curry over the top, allowing the beansprouts to cook in the residual heat.  Serve immediately.
