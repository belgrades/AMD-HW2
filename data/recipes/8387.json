With the motor running, gradually add the cream until the mixture is smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the chopped salmon pieces, coriander, basil and a squeeze of lemon juice. For the dressing, whisk the soy sauce, sesame oil and balsamic vinegar in a bowl. Add the ginger and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the ravioli, roll out the dough to the thinnest setting on the pasta machine. Cut the sheets into 24 rounds using a pastry cutter. Divide the salmon mixture into 12 equal portions and spoon onto the centre of 12 pasta circles. Brush the edges lightly with the beaten egg and place the remaining pasta circles on top. Press together to seal the edges. Trim the edges of the ravioli with scissors or a pastry cutter. You need 12 ravioli to serve three per person. Save any leftover pasta for another day (store in the fridge for up to 2-3 days). Bring a pot of salted water to the boil, adding a little olive oil to prevent sticking. Cook the pasta for 3-4 minutes, then drain. Meanwhile, to prepare to serve, heat the tablespoon of olive oil in a small saucepan and wilt the spinach for 1-2 minutes, adding salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Drain the spinach. To serve, arrange the wilted spinach into the centre of each serving plate. Place the salmon ravioli on top and drizzle with the dressing. Scatter with a few torn herb leaves and micro-cresses to garnish.
