Pour over the vegetable stock. Cover the bowl with cling film and place in the microwave. Cook on full power for four minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot then add the butter. When it starts to foam, add the spring onions and cook for one minute. Transfer the cooked broccoli and stock to a food processor. Add the fried spring onions, Stilton and cream and blend until smooth. Transfer the blended mixture to a pan and bring gently to a simmer. Meanwhile, for the croûtons, toast the French bread under a grill until golden-brown on each side. Top the grilled bread with the slices of Stilton and return to the grill until golden-brown and bubbling. Season the soup with salt, freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of nutmeg. Divide the soup equally among four warm bowls and top each with a Stilton croûton. Serve.
