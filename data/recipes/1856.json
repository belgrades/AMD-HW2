Add the onions and gently over a medium heat until softened and lightly golden-brown.  Add the garlic along with all the spices. Cook for a further minute, then push everything aside in the pan. Add the chicken pieces skin-side down and fry for a few minutes on each side. Season with salt and then pour over the stock or water. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer for around 45 minutes, or until the chicken is nearly falling off the bone. Turn the chicken regularly to prevent it sticking. Add half the preserved lemons and the olives and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley and coriander just before serving. Garnish with the remaining preserved lemon and serve immediately.
