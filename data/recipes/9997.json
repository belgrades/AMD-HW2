Place the salad onto a serving plate.  For the onion rings, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dredge the onion rings in the seasoned plain flour.  Place the self-raising flour into a large bowl, add the sparkling water and salt and whisk to make a thick batter. Add more sparkling water if necessary.  Dip the floured onion rings into the batter, then carefully place into the hot oil. Deep-fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden and crisp.  Remove the onion rings with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt. To serve, top the salad with the onion rings.
