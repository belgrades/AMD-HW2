{"recipe_name":"Freezer oaty bar","author":"Chris Bavin","programme":"Eat Well for Less?","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Makes 24 bars","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Lightly grease a 33x23cm\/13x9in baking tray that is about 3cm\/1in deep. Line the greased tray with cling film. Place the oats and almonds in a food processor and blend for 10-20 seconds until fairly well broken down (if they are still whole, they won’t stick together, but you do want some texture). Pulse the mixture until slightly powdery. Tip into a large bowl then add the seeds, cranberries and rice pops and stir really well. Heat the agave, peanut butter and honey in a small saucepan over a medium heat until melted together. Pour this over the oat mixture then mix well with a spoon, until cooled slightly, then mix with your hands to make sure all the oats are coated in the peanut butter mixture. Tip into the tin and spread out evenly. Lay a sheet of cling film over the top, then press down firmly to squash the mixture flat. Leave in the freezer for 1 hour until set. Remove the top layer of cling film, then tip out onto a board, remove the remaining cling film and cut into 24 bars. To keep, layer them up between sheets of greaseproof paper and store in a sealed box in the fridge. They can also be kept in the freezer.
