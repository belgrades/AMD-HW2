Shake the pan frequently, taking care not to burn the almonds. Remove from the pan and set aside.  In the same pan, heat half of the olive oil and fry the onion and chilli flakes together for 3-4 minutes, or until softened, then add the runner beans and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.  Pour in the wine and half-cover with a lid. Reduce the heat and simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the beans are tender but still have a bite. Stir in the toasted almonds.  In another pan, heat the remaining oil and fry the prawns for 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through. Drizzle over the honey and lemon juice in the last few minutes of cooking.  To serve, pile the runner bean salad onto a serving plate and scatter over the prawns. Drizzle over the juice from the pan, sprinkle over the cayenne pepper and garnish with the sprig of dill and lime half.
