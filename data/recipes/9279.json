Add the pork slices and stir to coat them in the marinade, then set aside in the fridge for half an hour. For the tabbouleh, mix the pomegranate seeds, tomatoes, spring onions, parsley, za’atar, and bulgur wheat in a large bowl until well combined.  Mix together the lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, honey and half of the olive oil in a separate bowl. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Combine the two mixtures and season again if necessary, then stir in the flaked almonds. Set aside. Heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the pork slices, in batches, for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown on both sides and cooked through. To serve, transfer all of the frying pan contents, including the oil, to a serving platter. Serve the tabbouleh in a large bowl alongside.
