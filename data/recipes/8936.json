Dust the ox cheeks with flour. Heat a casserole or an ovenproof pan and add the oil. Once hot, brown the ox cheeks then remove and set aside. Put all vegetables, wine, tomato purée and marmite in the casserole and fry until softened. Return the ox cheeks and cover with stock. Add the thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns, cover with a lid and cook in the oven for 3 hours, or until the beef is tender. Once the beef is cooked, remove the casserole from the oven and pass the cooking liquor through a fine sieve. Transfer to a clean pan and reduce until the volume of liquid has reduced to a rich sauce. For the apples and swede, heat a large frying pan or a sauté pan and add half the butter. Once the butter is foaming, add the swede and honey and cook for 1 minute. Add the apples and the remaining butter and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the apples and swede are tender. To serve, spoon the mash into a large piping bag and pipe swirls of the mash onto serving plates. Add a piece of beef to each plate.
