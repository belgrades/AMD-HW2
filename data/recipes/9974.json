Start adding the berries, firmest first and softest last and then the orange juice. Cook the berries for approximately 5 minutes and remove from the heat. Chill them in the fridge. Warm the wine and port in a pan. Soften the gelatine in a little cold water and slowly add to the wine. Once it is all incorporated place it in a flat container and chill it. Once the jelly has set, place it on a clean cloth and chop the jelly into small crystals, then put it back in the container.  Spoon the jelly into the centre of the plate and drizzle the berries around it to serve.
