Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Beat the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Slowly add the caster sugar, whisking well after each addition, until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Carefully fold in one-third of the icing sugar, then repeat with the remaining two-thirds. Spoon the meringue mixture into a piping bag and pipe 18 small dollops of meringue onto the lined baking tray. Make a small hollow in the top of each meringue with the back of a teaspoon (for the filling to go in), then bake in the oven for 1½ -1¾ hours, or until cooked through. Meanwhile, for the filling, blend the mango slices and lime zest to a purée in a food processor. Stir in the pulp of one of the passion fruit. To serve, spoon a little mango and passion fruit purée into the hollow of each meringue and drizzle over the remaining passion fruit pulp.
