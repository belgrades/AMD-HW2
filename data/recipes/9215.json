Add the shallots and fry for one minute, then add the peppers, paprika and tomato purée and fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and butter beans and simmer for 5-6 minutes. Meanwhile, heat another frying pan until hot. Add the olive oil and monkfish and fry until just browned. Add the monkfish pieces to the stew and simmer for 1-2 minutes, or until the monkfish is just cooked through. Add the sugar and lemon juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle with the flatleaf parsley. Meanwhile, for the salad, place all of the salad ingredients together in a bowl and mix well. For the dressing, whisk the dressing ingredients together in a clean bowl, then pour over the salad. Mix well to coat the salad. To serve, spoon some stew onto each plate and place a generous pile of salad alongside.
