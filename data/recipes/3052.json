Grease a 20cm\/8in round springform tin and line the base with baking paper. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave to cool slightly.  Mix together the almonds, polenta and baking powder in a small bowl. Beat the sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl until the mixture is light and pale. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Fold through the melted chocolate until completely incorporated. Tip the bowl of dry ingredients into the chocolate mixture and fold in using a spatula, until just combined. Add the vanilla extract and fold through. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 40 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean. Remove from the tin and leave to cool slightly on a wire rack.  For the sauce, put the butter, sugar and syrup in a saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil, then cook until the sugar has dissolved. Add the cream, vanilla and salt, then whisk. Bring to a steady simmer, then cook for 3 minutes, or until sticky and thick. Cut the warm cake into slices and serve with a little crème fraîche and a drizzle of sauce.
