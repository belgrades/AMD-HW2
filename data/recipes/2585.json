Place the shallots and carrots in a deep roasting tray or a very deep large pan. Add the wine, pork belly and five spice powder and then cover with cold water.  Place the lid on the pot or place a sheet of tin foil over the roasting tin to cover. Place in the oven to slowly braise for 4-5 hours, until the bones can easily be separated from the meat. Remove from the oven and allow to stand and cool in the cooking liquid.  Turn up the oven to 220C\/430F\/Gas 7. When the pork belly is cooled, drain off the cooking liquid. Remove the top layer of skin, leaving exposed a very thin layer of fat on the meat. Using a sharp knife, score a diamond shape into the fat and rub in the honey. Place in the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes, until the meat is cooked through, golden in colour and slightly crispy on top. Sprinkle with a little Maldon salt and coarsely ground black pepper and serve hot or cold.
