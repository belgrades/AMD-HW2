Stir in the rice and continue to stir for about two minutes while the rice cooks and becomes slightly opaque.  Carefully pour in the wine and chicken stock.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is cooked through (if it gets too thick, add more water) - this should take about 12-15 minutes.   Cover the asparagus and peas with boiling water and rapidly boil for about three minutes. Drain well. Stir the vegetables and the cheddar cheese into the cooked rice.   Grate a little parmesan over the top. This risotto is delicious served with roast chicken.
