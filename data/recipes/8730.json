Crush the potatoes roughly, with the back of a spoon, then spoon the potato into a 2in\/5cm oiled chefs ring on a plate and level the top with a palette knife. For the spinach, place a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the butter and olive oil and stir until melted. Add the spinach and cook until the spinach has wilted. Squeeze out the excess moisture then season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the scallops, heat a saucepan over a high heat. Rub the scallops with the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the scallops into the saucepan and fry for two minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through.  To serve, place the potato tower onto a serving plate and carefully remove the chefs ring. Spoon the spinach alongside and arrange the scallops on top of the spinach.
