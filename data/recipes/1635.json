Sift the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl. Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles coarse, fresh breadcrumbs. Pour in the milk and mix with a wooden spoon to create a soft dough. Add the crumbled cheese and ensure it is evenly distributed by gently kneading the dough with your hands. Shape the dough into a rough round and place on a baking tray dusted with flour. Press down on the top of the ball to flatten it slightly, then brush it with a little milk to glaze. Grate some extra cheese over the top, then score a deep cross into the dough with a sharp knife to allow it to break into individual pieces when cooked. Bake in the preheated oven for around 30 minutes, or until the cheese topping looks golden-brown and crisp. Serve warm with your favourite chutney or pickle.
