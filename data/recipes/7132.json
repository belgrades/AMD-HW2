Heat the butter and oil together in a frying pan until frothing, then add the flattened garlic and seasoned pork chops. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until browned, then turn the chops over and fry for a further 2-3 minutes. Lower the heat and continue cooking for 3-4 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through. Transfer the chops to a warm serving plate. Pour the wine into the pan to deglaze, scraping off the residue from the bottom of the pan. Bubble over a high heat for 4-5 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by two-thirds.   For the gremolata, mix together the parsley, garlic and lemon zest in a small bowl.  To serve, spoon the reduced white wine sauce around the pork chops and sprinkle over the gremolata.
