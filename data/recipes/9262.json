Cover with water and place on the heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and simmer for 1Â½ hours. Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the sticky chilli chicken, combine the rice wine vinegar and caster sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Add the soy, chilli and ginger and simmer for 4-5 minutes until just thickened and slightly sticky. Place the wings onto a roasting tray. Pour the sauce over the chicken and mix to coat fully, then roast in the oven for 20 minutes, basting occasionally with the sauce. Set aside and keep warm. Drain the beef ribs and pat dry with kitchen paper. Mix together the Chinese five spice, chilli, salt, pepper, garlic and spring onions in a large bowl. Add the ribs and mix to coat fully. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based pan or a deep-fat fryer to 190C\/375F. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Carefully place the ribs into the fryer and cook for two minutes until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oil with tongs and drain on kitchen paper. For the egg-fried rice, mix the eggs and sesame oil together in a bowl with a fork. Heat a wok until hot, then add the oil and rice and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until hot through. Add the eggs to the rice and continue to stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or until the eggs have set and the mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper and stir-fry for two more minutes then stir in the spring onions and the coriander. To serve, divide the ribs, chicken and egg-fried rice among four plates, and sprinkle with chopped coriander.
