Add the courgette strips and toss to coat thoroughly. Place the milk into a separate bowl and dip the courgette into the milk, then place into the flour again and toss to coat. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. The oil is ready when a breadcrumb dropped into it will sizzle gently. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Carefully add the courgette strips and deep-fry until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels. Serve in a warm bowl, sprinkled with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
