Lay the salmon on top and cover with the sea salt, sugar and whisky. Wrap the fish tightly in cling film and place in the fridge for 12 hours. Wash the salmon to remove the salt rub, then slice it thinly. To make the blinis, whisk together the flour, yeast, milk, salt and sugar. Set aside in a warm place to prove for an hour.  For the beetroot, heat the redcurrant jelly, cloves, whisky and vinegar in a saucepan. Simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by half. Strain through a sieve. Whisk in the mustard, then stir through the beetroot. Set aside until ready to serve. For the blinis, whisk the egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. When the batter has proved fold in the egg whites. To cook the blinis, melt the butter in a large frying pan. Add a tablespoon of batter to the pan per blini and cook until golden-brown on the underside. Flip over and cook the other side. Remove the blini and place onto kitchen paper. Repeat until you have used all the batter. Keep the blinis warm until ready to serve. To serve, place slices of salmon onto serving plates, with a few blinis, a spoonful of beetroot and a quenelle of crème fraîche. Garnish with mustard cress or micro herbs.
