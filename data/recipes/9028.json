Season with salt, black pepper and lemon juice then place in a bowl in the fridge until ready to serve.  Place the radishes, beetroot and watercress into a bowl and mix together to combine. Whisk the mustard, vinegar and olive oil together until emulsified then season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour over the radishes, beetroot and watercress. For the melba toast, preheat the grill to high. Grill both sides of the bread until golden-brown, then cut the toast slices in half horizontally.  Remove any soft bread from the middle and discard. Grill the soft inner sides until golden-brown, then cut the toast slices into quarters diagonally. To serve, place a quenelle of pâté onto a plate and spoon the salad alongside. Finish with a pile of toast alongside.
