{"recipe_name":"Marinated beef with olives, chocolate and rich veal jus","author":"Trish Deseine","programme":"Trish Deseine's Christmas Dishes","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/images\/ic\/448x252\/p04hhw3d.jpg","method":"Combine all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add the beef, stirring to cover both sides. Leave to marinate in the fridge for 1–2 hours. In a frying pan over a medium heat, cook the shallot in the oil until softened, but not browned. Remove from the frying pan and set aside.  Increase the heat and get the frying pan very hot. Lift the meat from the marinade and shake off any excess. Cook for 3–5 minutes both sides, or until cooked to your liking. Set aside on a warmed plate to rest for 3 minutes. Add the shallot back to the frying pan and add a little veal jus to deglaze. Stir in the olives and cook until warmed through. Season lightly, as the olives are already salty. Remove from the heat and add the chocolate, allowing it to melt in the residual heat and stirring to combine. Serve spooned over the beef.
