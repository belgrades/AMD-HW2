Place the flour into the food processor with the butter and a pinch of salt and blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add one of the eggs and the milk and blend again until it forms a thick dough.  Place the dough onto a floured surface and roll out to ½cm\/¼in thick. Cut out ten 5cm\/2in rounds and lay onto a baking sheet. Place a small amount of steak and Stilton onto each of the ten rounds and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fold one side of each dough circle over the top of itself to make ten half moon shapes and pinch the edges to seal. Break the remaining egg into a bowl and beat well, then brush each turnover with the beaten egg.  Transfer to the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown and completely cooked through.  Remove from the oven and serve straight away.
