In a bowl, cover the dates with the boiling water.  Add the bicarbonate of soda, stir until dissolved and set aside to cool.  In a clean bowl beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Gradually add the eggs and mix in well. Add the sifted flour and baking powder in batches and mix thoroughly.  Add the warm dates and their liquid and mix until combined. You should now have a wet batter that can be spooned into the ramekins (do not fill more than two thirds full).  Place the ramekins on a baking tray and bake in the centre of the oven for approximately 15 minutes, or until they are risen and firm to touch.  To make toffee sauce, in a pan gently heat all the ingredients except the cream. When the butter has melted whisk in the cream. To serve, turn out the puddings onto serving plates and pour the toffee sauce into serving containers or drizzle over the puddings.
