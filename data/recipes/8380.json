{"recipe_name":"Salmon en papillote with egg fried rice","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 220C\/440F\/Gas 7. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with the sesame seeds and set aside. Place the ginger, spring onions, lemongrass, garlic, chilli and water chestnuts into a bowl and mix together. Place the soy sauce, sherry and sesame oil into a separate bowl and whisk together. Place four large sheets of baking parchment (large enough to cover the salmon and fold over to form a parcel) onto a work surface. Divide the ginger and vegetables mixture into four portions and place half of each portion into the centre of the parchment. Top each with a piece of salmon fillet, then top the fillet with the remaining half of each vegetable portion. Sprinkle each portion of salmon and vegetables with equal amounts of the soy sauce mixture. Fold the baking parchment over the salmon and vegetables to form a parcel, folding up each side well, so that the liquid doesn't leak out. Place onto a roasting tray and bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is just cooked through. For the rice, heat a wok until hot, then add the oil and rice and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the rice is completely heated through. Place the eggs and sesame oil into a bowl and beat together with a fork. Add the egg mixture to the rice and continue to stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the mixture is dry. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir-fry for two minutes. Add the spring onions and stir-fry for 30 seconds. To serve, place a salmon parcel onto each plate and spoon some of the rice alongside. The diner should open their own parcel at the table.
