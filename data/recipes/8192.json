Heat the coconut oil in a frying pan over a low heat until melted, then set aside to cool. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the water, maple syrup, vanilla extract, lemon juice and zest, and salt until pale and fluffy. Sift in the coconut flour and bicarbonate of soda and whisk until the batter is smooth and thick. Whisk in the melted coconut oil or butter until well combined. Set aside for 5 minutes to rest.  When the batter has rested, use a spatula to evenly redistribute any leftover coconut oil in the reserved frying pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat until the fat is smoking.  Add 2 tablespoonfuls of the batter to the centre of the pan and swirl to evenly distribute. Fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the pancake can be lifted easily. Flip over, then fry on the other side for a further minute, or until cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm in the oven. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.      To serve, spoon a dollop of yoghurt into the centre of each pancake, then scatter over a good handful of blueberries. Roll up into a sausage shape and eat.
