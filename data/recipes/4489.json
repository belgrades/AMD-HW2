{"recipe_name":"Honey-battered whiting with chickpea dip","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the whiting, mix together the flour, smoked paprika and yeast in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the egg, one tablespoon of the honey and the cold water until well combined. Add this to the flour mixture and whisk well to form a batter. In a separate small bowl, combine the remaining honey with the hot water to make a dressing. Set aside.   Heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Pat the fish dry with kitchen paper, then coat in the batter and deep fry, in batches, in the hot oil for 5-6 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. For the hummus, place all of the hummus ingredients into a food processor and blend to a smooth purée. Spoon into a small serving bowl for dipping.  Place the whiting goujons on a serving dish and drizzle over the honey dressing. Serve with the bowl of hummus on the side.
