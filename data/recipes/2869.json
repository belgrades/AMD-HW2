(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)  Carefully lower the poppadums into the hot oil and fry for 30 seconds or until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the tomato chutney, heat the olive oil in a small saucepan, add the onion and fry gently for four minutes or until softened. Add the garlic and fry for one minute. Add the chopped tomato, brown sugar, chilli and red wine vinegar and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Stir in the herbs and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the sautéed spinach, melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the spinach and wilt in the hot butter. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drain off any excess water. To serve, place one poppadum onto a serving plate, top with half the tomato chutney and sautéed spinach and then layer up with the rest of the crisp poppadoms, chutney and spinach to make a tower. Serve immediately.
