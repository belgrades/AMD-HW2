Place the brown sugar, salt, red wine and orange juice into the same pan and heat until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid has reduced slightly to a syrupy sauce. Return the apple slices to the pan and warm through in the sauce. For the mint sauce, combine the ingredients in a bowl and stir well.
