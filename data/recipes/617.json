{"recipe_name":"Barbecued lamb ribs","author":"Neneh Cherry and Andi Oliver","programme":"Neneh and Andi Dish It Up","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 10","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl or basin and immerse the ribs in them. Cover with cling film and leave overnight in the fridge, if possible, otherwise marinate for an hour in the fridge.  Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Baste the ribs with the marinade and cover them with aluminium foil. Precook them in the oven for 20-30 minutes. Otherwise the sweet ingredients (cola and maple syrup) may char on the barbecue.  Prepare the barbecue. It should not be too hot - the coals should be grey and ashen, but still have good heat.  Place the ribs on the barbecue. Turn them over after about 40 minutes to give the other side some texture. After about 10 minutes, turn the ribs over again.  If you like your ribs slightly crisper put them under a preheated grill for about five minutes. Be careful not to burn them. Serve.
