Pull the tentacles away from the body. Remove the quill from inside the body and discard. Clean the body by running it under a tap or cleaning it in a bowl of water. Remove the 'ears' from either side of the squid body and remove the skin with your fingers. Cut the tentacles just below the eyes, being sure not to cut the ink sac. Be sure to remove the 'beak' at the base of the tentacles. Cut the squid body into rings. On a clean chopping board, crush the garlic with the flat edge of a knife blade. Peel away the skin. Sprinkle over the sea salt and crush the garlic to a fine paste with the knife. Finely chop the mint and coriander. Finely slice the chilli. Heat a frying pan over a moderate heat. Add the olive oil, garlic paste and chilli. Cook for a minute or two, until the garlic just begins to brown. Add the prepared squid to the pan and stir for a couple of minutes. Season with sea salt. Add the mint and coriander to the pan and stir. Remove the pan from the heat, and squeeze over the lime juice and serve immediately.
