Wrap each fig in two slices of prosciutto or speck bacon and secure with wooden cocktail sticks. Bake in the oven for about 5-6 minutes, until the bacon is nice and crisp. Meanwhile, sweat the shallots and garlic in one tablespoon of olive oil for a few minutes, then add the white wine. Boil to reduce by half, then add the dolcelatte cheese and cream.  Reduce until slightly thickened, but do not boil or the mixture will split because of the fat in the cheese. Season with salt and pepper and add the some of the herbs, reserving the rest of the herbs for later. Cook the pasta in a generous amount of boiling salted water, with a little olive oil in it, according to packet instructions (usually about 6-8 minutes for linguine). Drain it well. Combine the drained pasta with the sauce and divide between four serving plates. Remove the cocktail sticks from the wrapped figs and place one wrapped fig on top of each plate of pasta. Garnish with the shavings of parmesan and the remaining fresh herbs.
