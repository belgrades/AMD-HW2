Add the pine nuts and toast them for a few minutes until browned and fragrant.  Place the parmesan chunks in a food processor and add the basil leaves, garlic, toasted pine nuts and olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Blend for a few seconds until it begins to come together and is smooth. Taste the pesto for seasoning, and add a squeeze of lemon juice if you like. If not using straight away, you can store the pesto in a jar and will keep for a week in the fridge. Or you can put it into ice-cube trays and freeze.
