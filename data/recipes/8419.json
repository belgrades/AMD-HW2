{"recipe_name":"Salt and pepper chilli squid with pak choi","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Heat a frying pan until smoking, then add the black peppercorns and Sichuan peppercorns and dry fry for a few seconds, shaking the pan frequently, until the peppercorns darken slightly and become aromatic.  Tip the peppercorns into a pestle and mortar and crush to a coarse mixture, then stir in the sea salt.  Heat a wok over a high heat until smoking, then add half of the sunflower oil and half of the squid. Stir fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the squid is just beginning to colour. Tip out onto a plate, then add the remaining oil and the rest of the squid, stir frying for 1-2 minutes, or until the squid is lightly coloured.  Return the first batch of the squid to the pan, then sprinkle over half of the salt and peppercorn mixture. (You can save the remaining mixture for another recipe.) Toss together for about 10 seconds, or until the squid is evenly coated with the mixture, then add the red chilli and spring onions. Stir fry over a high heat for a further 30 seconds, or until the squid is golden-brown. Remove the squid from the wok and keep warm.  For the pak choi, place the pak choi into a steamer that will fit over a pan of boiling water. Cover with a lid and steam the pak choi for 2-3 minutes, or until wilted and tender. Heat a frying pan until smoking, then add the vegetable oil, followed by the garlic, chilli, ginger and spring onions. Stir fry for one minute, then add the pak choi and sesame oil and mix well to combine.   To serve, pile the pak choi onto the centre of a serving plate and top with the squid. Serve garnished with a wedge of lime.
