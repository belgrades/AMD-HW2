Season the pork fillet and brush with honey. Heat a frying pan until hot and add the butter. When foaming, add the pork. Sear on each side until golden brown. Place in the oven and cook for 8-10 minutes until just cooked through - juices will run clear when pierced when the pork is cooked. Remove from the oven and rest for five minutes. To make the rösti, grate the potatoes and apple on a large grater into a tea towel. Twist the tea towel around and squeeze out any water and starch. Place the dry potato mix into a bowl and add the créme fraîche and egg yolks. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fill a 8cm\/3in chefs' ring halfway with the potato mix. Place a prune on top. Fill to the top with the remaining potato mix and press down firmly. Heat a frying pan until hot and add the butter. Place the rösti into the pan. Remove the ring and cook the rösti for 2-3 minutes on either side until golden brown and crisp.  Serve the rösti with the sliced pork fillet.
