{"recipe_name":"Sea bass baked in a crust with turmeric potatoes","author":"Richard Phillips","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the sea bass, place the flour, salt, egg yolk and herbs into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until combined. Add a little cold water if required and continue to pulse until a dough forms. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface and wrap the sea bass in it. Press the edges of the pastry together to seal. Transfer to a baking sheet and cook in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry crust is golden-brown and the fish is completely cooked through. For the turmeric potatoes, place the potatoes and turmeric in a pan of water and bring to the boil. Cook the potatoes until tender, about 8-10 minutes, and then drain. To serve, place the pastry-crusted fish onto a large serving plate and open up the pastry crust to reveal the cooked fish inside. Arrange the potatoes around the edge and garnish with the parsley sprigs and lemon wedges.
