For the ciabatta cubes, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the ciabatta cubes until crisp and golden-brown. Set aside in a bowl. In the same pan, melt the butter and fry the bacon lardons until crisp and golden-brown. Remove the bacon from the pan and transfer it to the bowl, leaving the remaining fat in the pan. Add the chicken livers to the pan and fry for 1½ minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and completely cooked through. Add the livers to the bowl with the ciabatta cubes and bacon, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. For the dressing, place the oil and mustard into a bowl and whisk together until thickened. Add the lemon juice, garlic and honey. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. Add the herbs to the bowl with the dressing and stir well to coat the leaves. To serve, place the dressed herbs onto a plate with the chicken livers, bacon and ciabatta cubes on top.
