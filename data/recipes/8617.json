Once cool, peel and set aside. Meanwhile, blend the tofu and breadcrumbs in a food processor, then add the remaining two eggs, the black pudding, garlic, herbs, cinnamon, lemon juice and zest, and blend together until smooth. Carefully mould the mixture around each of the boiled eggs, making sure there are no gaps. For the coating, mix the breadcrumbs and polenta together in a bowl until well combined. Dip each Scouse egg in the breadcrumb mixture until completely covered. Half-fill a deep, heavy-based pan with vegetable oil and heat until a breadcrumb dropped in sizzles and turns golden-brown in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the Scouse eggs for 5-6 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Carefully remove the eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Meanwhile, for the pickle, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the onion for 5-6 minutes, or until softened. Add the chilli and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.  Heat the vinegar, sugar and tamarind paste in a saucepan until boiling. Blanch the cauliflower florets in the vinegar mixture for 2-3 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon. Stir the cornflour mixture into the vinegar mixture and remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the cooked onion and cauliflower, then set aside to cool.
