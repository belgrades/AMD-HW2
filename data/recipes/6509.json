Rub the butter into the flour, by hand or in a food processor, until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the parmesan, seasoning and cayenne pepper. Work the mixture together into a ball and then knead briefly on a work surface lightly dusted with flour until smooth. Cut the dough in half, flatten each piece slightly, then roll out thinly between 2 large sheets of cling film. Lift off the top piece of cling film and cut into 5cm\/2in biscuits.  Carefully lift them onto a lightly buttered baking sheet, then knead together and re-roll the trimmings to make more biscuits. You should make about 30 biscuits in total. Bake the biscuits for 8-10 minutes until crisp and golden. Leave to cool on the baking sheets. Store in an airtight tin.
