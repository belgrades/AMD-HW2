Place the chicken wings and pork bones in a roasting tin and into the preheated oven. Roast for 30-40 minutes, turning them half way through until golden-brown. Alternatively you can fry the bones until browned if you don’t have an oven.  When cooked, strain the wings and bones in a colander or large sieve and then pour a kettle of boiling water over them to remove excess grease. While the chicken is in the oven, rinse the dried kombu under cold running water. Soak the kombu in a large stock pot for 30 minutes in 2.5 litres\/4½ pints cold water. The kombu will triple in size. Remove the kombu from the water and cut into three long strips. Return to the stockpot and bring up to a simmer. Remove from the heat and discard the kombu - do not boil the kombu in the water for a long time or the dashi will become bitter. Add the roasted and rinsed wings and bones along with all the remaining ingredients to the kombu water. Bring up to the boil, reduce the heat, put a lid on and simmer for two hours. Do not let the stock boil as it will become cloudy. After two hours, strain the stock carefully through some clean muslin or a jay cloth. Leave to drain gently for 10 minutes, cool and refrigerate until required.
