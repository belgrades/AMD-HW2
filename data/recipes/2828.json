Meanwhile, heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan. It is ready when a breadcrumb dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)  Mix the spring onion ingredients together in a bowl to form a thick batter. Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot oil for 1-2 minutes until golden. Drain on kitchen towels. Stir the sauce through the pasta and garnish with chives, the crunchy spring onions and a dusting of paprika.
