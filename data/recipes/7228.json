{"recipe_name":"Potato pancakes with smoked salmon and horseradish cream","author":"John Torode","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the horseradish cream, add the horseradish to a bowl and sprinkle with the vinegar and salt. Leave to sit for 10 minutes and then mix with the crème fraîche. Set aside until ready to serve. For the potato pancakes, fill a pan with boiling salted water. Add the potatoes and cook until soft. Drain well  and return to pan, add milk and mash well.   Stir in potato flour and gradually add the whole egg followed by the egg whites. Stir in the cream, season with salt and pepper.   Warm a frying pan over a medium heat and grease with a little butter. Pour a ladle of the potato mixture into the pan and cook for 5 minutes until well coloured around the edges. Turn over and cook for a further 3 minutes, or until cooked through and golden-brown. Repeat with the remaining potato mix.  To make the dressing, put the mustard and vinegar in a bowl and whisk until blended.  Slowly add the oils, still whisking. Season with salt and pepper.  The dressing will keep for up to 1 month in an airtight jar. For the salad, mix the herbs and shallot in a bowl. Just before serving pour over the dressing and mix. For the poached eggs, put water and the vinegar in a deep saucepan and bring to a rolling boil. Break the eggs in, when they float to the top cook for a further 2 minutes.  Place the pancakes on a serving plate and top with the salmon, poached eggs, salad and horseradish cream. Garnish with the lemon juice and dill drizzle over a little olive oil.
