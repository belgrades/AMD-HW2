Pour the sugar into an oven tray and bake for 30 minutes. Whisk the egg whites while adding the warm sugar. Whisk well until the whites form a hard peak shape when the whisk is removed. Line an oven tray with baking paper. Spoon mounds of the egg white onto the baking tray in rough shapes approximately the size of a tennis ball. Sprinkle with cinnamon and bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a simmering pan of water. When the meringues are cooked, flatten the tops down.
