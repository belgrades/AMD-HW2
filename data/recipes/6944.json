Wash rice with cold water. Drain and repeat the process twice. Add clean water to the rice.  Cook rice over high heat, bring to the boil, uncovered.  Switch to very low heat and cover with a lid. Simmer the rice for 15-20 minutes. Do not take lid off until time is up. (This is the crucial as the rice is steam-cooked under pressure.) When done, fluff up the rice with a fork or chop sticks and serve hot.
