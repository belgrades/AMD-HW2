{"recipe_name":"Sultana scones with black pepper and strawberry jam and clotted cream","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 220C\/425F\/Gas 7. For the scones, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Stir in the sugar, then add the butter and, with clean hands, rub quickly into the flour, creating a fine breadcrumb consistency. Add the sultanas. Add the milk, a little at a time, working with your hands to create a smooth dough. Leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before rolling. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface until 2cm\/1in thick. Using a 5cm\/2in pastry cutter, cut the dough, using one sharp tap and not twisting the dough as you cut (twisting the scone mix will result in the scone rising unevenly). Once cut, the scones can be either brushed with the beaten egg for a shiny glaze, or dusted with the flour for a matt finish once cooked. Place the scones onto a greased baking tray and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Allow to cool slightly, and serve while still warm with jam and cream. For the jam, place the sugar, lemon zest and juice and water into a large pan over a low heat and heat until the sugar has dissolved. Add the strawberries and black pepper and stir gently. Bring the pan to the boil and cook for 3-4 minutes, or up to ten minutes if you prefer a thicker jam. Check the temperature with a sugar thermometer - it should reach 105C\/220F. Leave to cool slightly, skimming off any froth with a clean spoon to stop the jam from going cloudy. Spoon the jam into sterile jam jars, seal and label with the date.
