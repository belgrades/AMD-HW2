Transfer the toasted seeds to a pestle and mortar and lightly crush them. Place the crushed coriander seeds into a pan with the water and bring to the boil. Place the yoghurt into a bowl and add the yeast. Pour the coriander seeds and water into the yoghurt mixture and stir well. Add 200g\/7oz of the flour and use your hands to combine well. Cover the bowl and leave to prove for 25 minutes (preferably somewhere warm, but this isn't essential). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Add the salt, oil and remaining flour and mix well to completely combine. Place the dough back into its bowl, cover and leave to prove for one hour. (The dough should have nearly doubled in size.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it lightly for one minute. Divide the dough into six and roll into little balls. Roll each ball out flat to 10cm-12.5cm\/4in-5in circles. Heat a griddle pan or large shallow pan. Brush each circle of dough with a little oil and cook the flatbreads for about 30 seconds on each side, or until golden-brown all over. For the hummus, place all of the hummus ingredients, except the oil, into a food processor and blend until smooth. With the food processor motor running, add a steady stream of oil, to loosen the mixture, until at the consistency of your choice.   Transfer the hummus to a dish or bowl and garnish with the olives and chargrilled chilli. To serve, place the bowl of hummus onto a large plate and place the flatbreads around the bowl.
