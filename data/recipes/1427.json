Add the onion, cover and fry for 3-4 minutes. Add the carrots and ground coriander and gently fry for a further 2-3 minutes. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Add the chopped coriander then put the soup in a blender and pulse until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. Alternatively, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it.  Heat the butter and 125ml\/4fl oz water in a saucepan until boiling, then boil for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the flour and cayenne pepper using a wooden spoon until smooth, or until the mixture comes away from the side of the pan. Return the pan to the heat and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously. Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating well before adding the second egg. Stir in the white and brown crabmeat and mix until well combined, then season with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle. Carefully pipe 1½cm\/½in long sections into the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove the beignets from the pan using a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and season with salt.  To serve, ladle the soup into bowls, scatter over some crab beignets. Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with the baby coriander.
