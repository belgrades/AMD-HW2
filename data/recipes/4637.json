Using a fork, start incorporating the flour with the water and olive oil, if necessary add more water. Once the dough starts to come together, use your hands to form a soft ball of dough.  Dust your hands and a clean work surface with flour and knead the dough for five minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.  Put the dough back into the bowl, cover and set aside for 15 minutes. (This dough is much firmer to handle than bread dough and will feel heavier.) Divide the dough into five equal balls. Roll them out to the thickness of a £2 coin. Heat a griddle pan and cook the flat breads for two minutes on each side. Serve immediately.
