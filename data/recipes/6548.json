Grease two ramekin dishes with butter and sprinkle with one tablespoon of the caster  sugar. Place the egg whites into a large clean bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Add the remaining sugar and whisk again until thick and glossy. Place the custard into a separate large bowl, add the passion fruit seeds and pulp and mix well. Gently fold in the whisked  egg whites. Spoon the mixture into the prepared ramekins and place onto a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.   Meanwhile, for the bananas, heat the butter in a non-stick pan until it turns slightly brown. Add the sugar and the bananas and cook, stirring frequently, until the bananas are golden-brown all over. To serve, place the soufflés onto serving plates in their ramekin dishes. Place the bananas alongside and serve  with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Garnish with fresh mint.
