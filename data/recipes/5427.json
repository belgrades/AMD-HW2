Place the milk and lemon zest into a pan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and leave to cool for ten minutes.  Add the butter and sugar to the lemon-infused milk, then return to the heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Add the breadcrumbs and stir well. Then stir in the egg yolks. Place six small soufflé dishes or ramekins into a deep baking tray. Pour equal quantities of the mixture into each ramekin. Pour water into the baking tray so that the water comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins (this is a bain marie). Carefully place into the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the puddings are set. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Increase the oven temperature to 240C\/445F\/Gas 8. Meanwhile, whisk the egg whites and sugar together until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Spoon on a good dollop of raspberry jam onto the middle of each of the puddings, then cover with the egg white mixture. Return the puddings to the oven in the bain marie and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the meringue is set. Remove from the oven and serve the puddings in their ramekins.
