Make a well in the centre and add half of the water. Using your hands, bring the mixture together, adding a little bit of water at a time, until the mixture forms a dough (you may not need all of the water). Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead the dough for about ten minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Dust the dough with some more flour and place it back into the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Set aside for one hour in a warm, dry place, or until the dough has risen. (You can also lightly brush the outsides of the dough with olive oil to prevent the dough from drying out too much.) Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Grease a baking sheet with some olive oil. Roll the dough out into a very thin layer about 3-5mm thick, and cut out long ovals from the sheet (the dough should yield approximately ten pitta breads). Place the pitta breads onto the oiled baking tray and bake in the oven for 5-6 minutes, or until the pitta bread begin to puff up and turn golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set aside. Cover the pitta breads with a slightly damp clean tea towel to prevent the breads from drying out and becoming brittle. For the chilli sauce, place the sugar and water into a non-reactive saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and the liquid has reduced to a thick syrup.  Add the grated ginger, chilli and garlic to the pan and add a splash of rice wine vinegar and a splash of fish sauce. Stir well and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Transfer the chilli sauce mixture into a food processor and blend until smooth, then  cover and chill in the fridge until needed. For the coriander hummus, place the chickpeas, tahini paste, garlic and olive oil into a food processor and blend until smooth. Add the chopped fresh coriander and the lemon juice and blend again to combine.  Preheat the grill to high.  For the lamb kofta kebabs, place all of the kebab ingredients together in a bowl and mix together with your hands until the meat sticks together.  With damp hands, take a handful of the kebab mixture and shape into a long sausage shape around a metal skewer. Repeat with the remaining kebab mixture, using a new skewer each time (or fit two kebabs onto each skewer, if space allows). Place the skewers under the grill for 10-12 minutes, turning them halfway, until the lamb is golden-brown and cooked through. Slide the kebabs off the skewers and set aside.  For the salad, mix all of the salad ingredients together in a large bowl.  To serve, place a few pitta breads onto each serving plate along with a few lamb kofta kebabs. Arrange the salad alongside and place the chilli sauce and hummus into small bowls for sharing.
