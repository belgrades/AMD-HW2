{"recipe_name":"Couscous with pine nuts","author":"Elizabeth Guy","programme":"Countryfile Summer Diaries","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Place the couscous, salt and pine nuts in a lidded saucepan and stir well. Pour the water over (it should be about 2cm\/¾in above the couscous). Put the pan lid on and leave until ready to serve.  Gently fork the couscous to break up the grains, before transferring to a bowl to serve. This makes a great salad meal if you let the couscous go cold and keep in the fridge. If you are serving the couscous with a spicy main, leave this dish the way it is and serve hot. If you're serving it with a plainer meat, such as lamb chops, you could soften some onion in olive oil, and add fresh ginger, chilli and garlic before adding the couscous to the pan.
