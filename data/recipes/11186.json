Slice each chicken breast into five strips, and add them to the marinade. Stir to combine, and leave to marinate for at least an hour (longer if possible). Remove from the fridge and thread the chicken strips onto wooden skewers. Heat a large griddle pan until hot, then add the chicken skewers. Cook for three minutes on each side until browned and cooked through. For the jam, place all the ingredients into a saucepan and bring to the boil.
