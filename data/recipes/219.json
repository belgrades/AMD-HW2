Scatter the ginger, garlic, tomato, chilli and yellow pepper over and around the fish and the cardamom pods in between.   Empty the coconut milk into a separate bowl, add a good sprinkling of sea salt and gradually stir in the lime juice.  Pour the mixture gently over and around the fish and cover the dish. Preheat the oven to 150C\/300F\/Gas 2.  Put the dish on the centre shelf and cook for 40-50 minutes, until the fish is lightly done. To discover this insert a small, sharp knife into the centre of one of the steaks - if the flesh is slightly darker pink in the centre it will be perfectly cooked.  Remove from the oven.   Before serving scatter the mint leaves on top.
