(CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the flour in a bowl with the baking powder and whisk in enough water to make a smooth batter, the consistency of double cream.  Dip the squid in the batter to coat.  Deep-fry in the hot oil for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen paper. For the chutney, heat the onion, tomatoes, sugar, balsamic vinegar and coriander in a pan for 8-10 minutes, or until soften. Transfer to a serving plate and serve the tempura squid alongside.
