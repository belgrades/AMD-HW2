Add the lentils, stir well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the oil in a frying pan and slowly pour in enough batter to coat the bottom of the pan. Fry for two minutes, or until golden-brown underneath, then carefully turn the pancake over and fry the other side for a further two minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter. For the filling, heat the rapeseed oil in a frying pan add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. Add the green pepper and mushrooms and fry until the mushrooms are soft. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir through the chopped parsley.
