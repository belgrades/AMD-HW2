For the sauce vierge, pour the olive oil into a non-reactive pan. Whisk in the lemon juice until well combined. Add the chopped tomatoes, shallot, garlic and capers. Heat the pan over a medium heat until the mixture is just warmed through. Add the basil, chervil, dill, parsley and chives and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
