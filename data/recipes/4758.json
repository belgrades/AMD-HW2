Stir with your hands until a dough is formed. Slowly add the remaining water and knead the dough in the bowl for four minutes.  (Alternatively, you could mix with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook). Tip dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead well for 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for an hour. Tip the dough out onto a very lightly floured surface, and knock it back by kneading it a few times. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Place all balls onto a floured baking tray and allow to rise for an hour. Preheat a deep fat fryer, filled with sunflower oil, to 180C\/350F. Lower each doughnut into the fryer, cooking each side for about five minutes or until golden brown. Remove the doughnuts from the oil with a slotted spoon and immediately roll in caster sugar so that the hot fat makes the sugar stick to the sides. Set aside and leave to cool. When completely cool, using a small, sharp, knife make a cut into the side of the doughnut, reaching to the centre.   Spoon some smooth or sieved strawberry jam into a piping bag, or piping syringe.  Pipe, or syringe, the jam generously inside.
