{"recipe_name":"Ham and sage pork fillet with buttered tagliatelle","author":"Nick Nairn","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Trim the pork fillet of any fat and gristle.   Slice crosswise into eight even-sized pieces. Put each piece between sheets of cling film, end grain facing up, and beat out thinly, using a rolling pin or a meat mallet to flatten without tearing. Season each escalope with a little pepper.  Lay half a slice of ham on each escalope, put a sage leaf on top and secure through the middle of the whole lot - as if you were making a large stitch - with a cocktail stick.  They are not rolled up.  Dust each of the escalopes with flour on both sides. Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the butter and wait until foaming.   Fry the escalopes four at a time over a high heat, for 1Â½ minutes, sage-side down.  Flip them over and fry for another 30 seconds, until golden brown and tender.  Remove and keep warm while you cook the next four. Serve piping hot, with buttered tagliatelle and a simple rocket and parmesan salad, and plenty of lemon to squeeze over.
