Heat the oil in a heavy lidded casserole dish large enough to hold the turkey crown snugly. Brown the turkey and onions for a few minutes. Add the ground cinnamon, a little salt, saffron, sugar and a glass or two of water. Put the lid on and cook in the oven for 2 hours, or until tender and falling off the bone. You may need to top up the water occasionally. When cooked, remove from the oven. Chop the almonds finely in a food processor (they taste better this way than when bought ready-chopped) and stir them into the casserole.  Turn the oven up to 200C\/180C Fan\/Gas 6.  For the pastry, brush the melted butter over the sheets of filo pastry. Pile them onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. Cook the pastry for about 5 minutes or until crisped and golden-brown. Dust the pastry with icing sugar and cinnamon, and serve alongside the turkey.
