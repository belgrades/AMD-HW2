Slice each mango half into three wedges. Heat the olive oil in a small non-stick frying pan and fry the mango slices, cut-side down for two minutes on each side. Drizzle over two tablespoons of honey for the last minute of frying the mango. Arrange the mango wedges on a serving plate. In a small bowl, whisk the cream and icing sugar together until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.   Add the lime zest and Greek-style yoghurt to the cream and briefly whisk again to combine. To serve, spoon the cream mixture into a small bowl and drizzle with the extra tablespoon of honey. Serve alongside the mango wedges.
