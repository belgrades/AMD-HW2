Mix 130ml\/4¼fl oz boiling water with the salt and lard in a small saucepan. Gently heat until the lard melts, stirring all the time to combine. Pour the lard and water mixture on top of the flour mixture, stirring with a spoon until everything comes together to form a soft dough. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and bring together into a ball. Leave to rest for about 10 minutes until cool enough to handle. Take one-third of the pastry, wrap in cling film and transfer to the fridge to chill. Line a terrine mould with baking paper. Roll out the larger piece of pastry to fit the terrine mould. Lay the pastry into the baking paper and use your hands to pull the pastry up the sides so it lines the mould up to the top. Place in the fridge for 20 minutes. For the game terrine, preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. Roll out the reserved third of pastry to form the pie lid and set aside.  Fill the chilled terrine mould with the game filling and place the pastry top on the pie. Crimp round the sides, to seal thoroughly. Brush the lid of the pie with the egg wash. Bake for 1-1¼ hours. For the shallot chutney, place the butter in a large frying pan and heat until melted. Add the shallots, cover and cook on a low heat until the shallots have softened and caramelised. Add the sugar, thyme and vinegar and cook for a further 10 minutes. To serve, cut a few slices of the game terrine pie and serve with the melba toast and shallot chutney.
