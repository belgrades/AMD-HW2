{"recipe_name":"Smoked chicken and spring onion risotto","author":"Mark Sargeant","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"To prepare, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the rice and cook for five minutes. Drain well, then spread out onto a lightly oiled tray. Allow the rice to cool slightly, then cover with cling film and set aside until ready to cook. When ready to cook, bring the stock to the boil in a pan. Reduce the heat to a low simmer. Heat the olive oil in another span. Add the shallots and stir over medium heat for 3-4 minutes, until the shallots are beginning to soften. Add the part-cooked rice and stir well. Stir frequently for a couple of minutes. Add the white wine and bring to the boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until almost all of the wine has reduced. Add a third of the stock and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid. Add another third of stock and stir again until the liquid has nearly all been absorbed by the rice. When the stock has been absorbed, taste the rice to see if it is cooked but still al dente. If not ready, add a little more stock and cook for a few more minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the smoked chicken and spring onions and stir to mix well. Add the mascarpone, parmesan and butter and stir to combine and melt. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, spoon equal amounts of the risotto into four warmed bowls. Drizzle over a little olive oil and sprinkle over the chopped parsley.
