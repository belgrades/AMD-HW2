Season to taste and set aside. For the peaches, lightly grease a griddle pan or barbecue with the oil and then get it nice and hot. You may have to work in batches, depending on the size of your pan. Place the peach quarters, cut-side down on the griddle pan or barbecue for 1-2 minutes to give a nice chargrilled mark on them.  Use a metal fish slice to help lift them up so as not to leave the chargrilled marks behind. Turn them onto their other cut side for another minute (don’t cook on their skin side). The charring will add to the flavour. You can also use a frying pan to cook them, but obviously you won’t get the char-grilled lines on them. Sit the peaches cut side up on a large serving platter as you go.  Arrange the buratta chunks (or mozzarella) around the peaches and scatter the rocket and basil leaves over. Scatter a little salt and pepper on top. Quickly whisk up the dressing again if necessary, drizzle it over and serve.
