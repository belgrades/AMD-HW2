Season the pork with the cumin and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Melt a knob of butter in a large ovenproof pan over a medium heat. Brown the pork loins on all sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook the pork for about 12 minutes, until cooked through. The jucies will run clear when the pork is pierced with a skewer. For the figs and balsamic dressing, heat the sugar and butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until they begin to caramelise.  Add the balsamic vinegar and stir to form a syrup. Take the pan off the heat and immediately add the figs, pomegranate seeds, orange zest and pistachio nuts, coating them all in the syrup. Set aside. To serve, slice the pork and serve on watercress with the sauce spooned over with the hot roast potatoes.
