{"recipe_name":"Classic Bakewell tart","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 10-12","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 190C\/375F\/Gas 5. Roll the sweet shortcrust pastry out onto a lightly dusted work surface to a 0.5cm\/¼in thickness. Carefully line a 23cm\/9in, deep-sided tart tin with the pastry, pressing the pastry into the edges of the tin. Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper and fill with baking beans or rice. Place the tart tin onto a baking tray, then bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the greaseproof paper and baking beans or rice, then return the tart case to the oven and bake for a further 8-10 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and pale golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, until all of the eggs have been fully incorporated into the mixture. Fold in the ground almonds until well combined. When the pastry case has cooled, spread the raspberry jam in an even layer all over the bottom of the tart. Spoon in the almond mixture and smooth the surface with a palette knife. Dust the top of the tart with icing sugar, then sprinkle over the flaked almonds. Return the tart to the oven and continue to cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the filling has risen and is cooked through and the surface is pale golden-brown. (NB: The filling is cooked through when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.) Remove the tart from the oven and set aside to cool slightly before serving. To serve, place one slice of Bakewell tart into the centre of each of 10-12 serving plates. Place a spoonful of clotted cream on top of each slice. Drizzle the double cream around the edge of each plate.
