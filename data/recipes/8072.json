Preheat the oven the 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Peel the lemons and chop up the skin. In a large bowl mix the lemon skin with the parsley, olive oil, wine and anchovies. Season. Mix well and divide the mixture between the four fish, stuffing them very gently in order not to break the fish. Slice the peeled lemons and place on a baking tray. Place the fish on top of the slices. Cook in the oven for about 16 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together all the salsa ingredients to make the salsa. When cooked, gently remove and discard the stuffing. Place the fish onto a serving plate and re-stuff with the salsa. Serve immediately with a glass of Italian dry white wine, if you like.
