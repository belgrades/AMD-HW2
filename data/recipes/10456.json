{"recipe_name":"Toffee apple sponge pudding","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Makes 8 puddings","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/food\/ic\/food_16x9_608\/recipes\/toffeeapplespongepud_92633_16x9.jpg","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the sponge, beat the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until pale and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, beating each egg into the mixture until fully incorporated before adding the next. Fold in the flour until well combined. Add a splash of milk to loosen the mixture, as necessary. (NB: The mixture should be of dropping consistency.) Fold in the ginger. Place the chopped apples and sugar into a pan and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and is bubbling and the apple has softened. For the sauce, bring all of the sauce ingredients to the boil in a pan, stirring constantly to form a smooth sauce that is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. Spoon a little of the sauce into eight dariole moulds. Divide the cooked apple equally among the moulds, then spoon over the sponge mixture. Place the dariole moulds into a large, deep-sided roasting tray. Pour enough boiling water into the roasting tray to reach halfway up the sides of the dariole moulds. (NB: This is called a bain-marie.) Cover the tray with aluminium foil, then transfer to the oven and cook for 25 minutes, or until the sponge has risen and is pale golden-brown.  Turn out one sponge pudding onto each of six serving plates. Drizzle any remaining sauce around the edge of the plates. Drizzle the custard over the sponge puddings.
