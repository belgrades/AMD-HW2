Add the lentils and the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to simmer for 20 minutes, or until the lentils are soft. Make four 'wells' in the lentil mixture and crack an egg into each hole. Cover the pan with a lid for 4-5 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking. Sprinkle with coriander and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add a pinch of paprika to the top of each egg. To serve, carefully spoon a portion of the lentils with an egg onto each plate. Place a warmed naan bread alongside each plate and serve with cucumber raita.
