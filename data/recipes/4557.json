Brush the filo pastry with the melted butter and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the centre.  Bunch up the filo to make a parcel, dust with icing sugar and place in a preheated oven at 220C\/425F\/Gas 7 for 2-3 minutes.  While the filo parcels are cooking, preheat a griddle pan and brush the bananas and figs with a little of the butter.  Griddle the bananas and figs on both sides and when cooked, place on a plate.  Remove the parcels from the oven and serve on the side of the plate. Drizzle with the honey, a further dusting of icing sugar and garnish with a sprig of mint.
