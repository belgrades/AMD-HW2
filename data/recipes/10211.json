For the spiced almonds, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the almonds until lightly toasted. Sprinkle over the salt and spices and stir well, then pour into a small bowl. For the deep-fried squid, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Season the flour with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then dredge the squid rings in the flour, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the squid rings into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt. Place into a small bowl. For the pomegranate dipping sauce, place the pomegranate seeds into a pan with the balsamic vinegar and oil and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Pour into a small bowl. For the almond-stuffed olives, place an almond inside each olive. Heat the oil in a pan and fry the olives for 3-4 minutes, then place into a small serving bowl. For the roasted pepper,  place the pepper half on a baking sheet and drizzle with the oil. Sprinkle the sliced garlic and thyme over the pepper and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for ten minutes, or until softened and lightly charred at the edges. Remove from the oven, cut into slices and place into a small bowl. To serve, place all of the bowls of tapas onto a large platter.
