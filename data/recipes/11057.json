{"recipe_name":"Whisky mustard crusted pork chop with sautéed potatoes","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat the whisky, honey, lemon juice and water into a saucepan and heat until the honey dissolves. Stir in the mustard seeds and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Blend the mixture in a food processor until creamy (this will take a few minutes). Sprinkle the breadcrumbs onto a plate. Brush the pork chop on one side with the mustard mixture and dredge in the breadcrumbs. Spoon the remaining mustard into a small bowl and set aside. Heat the olive oil and butter in an ovenproof frying pan until hot. Fry the pork chops for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on each side.  Transfer to the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest. For the sautéed potatoes, heat the olive oil and half of the butter in a frying pan until hot.  Fry the potatoes for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown and tender. Add the garlic and rosemary and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the remaining butter in a frying pan, add the spinach and water and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted. To serve, spoon some potatoes onto each of 4 serving plates, top with a pork chop and spoon some spinach alongside.  Serve with the remaining mustard.
