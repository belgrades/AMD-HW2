When it turns brown, drop the fish into the butter and cook over a medium heat for five minutes. Dot the top of the fish with a further 50g\/1¾oz of butter and sprinkle with sea salt, black pepper and a squeeze of lemon. Place under a hot grill for six minutes. Meanwhile, in a deep sauté pan, add another 50g\/1¾oz of butter, the sliced fennel and shallot. Sauté for three minutes, then add the white wine and shellfish. Put the lid on and cook for two minutes. Place the sole on a serving dish, then lift out the fennel and shellfish and place around the sole. To finish, turn up the heat in the sauté pan and add the Pernod, then whisk in the rest of the butter, allowing the sauce to emulsify.
