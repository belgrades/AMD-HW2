{"recipe_name":"Plum baba with crème fraîche ice cream","author":"Ed Baines","programme":"Chefs: Put Your Menu Where Your Mouth Is","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the crème fraîche ice cream, place the milk and vanilla in a saucepan and warm. Put the egg yolks and sugar in a large mixing bowl and whisk until you reach the ‘ribbon stage’ (when the mixture leaves a trail on the surface of the eggs when the whisk is raised out of the bowl and moved across it.) Gradually add the milk to the bowl, whisking continuously. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and warm on a low heat, continually whisking until it thickens. Allow to cool completely and stir in the crème fraîche. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions. Place in the freezer to set. For the plums, set two cut plums aside and place the rest in a medium saucepan with 100ml\/3½fl oz water and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until soft.  Remove from the heat, place in a blender and blend until smooth. Put in a squeezy bottle and set aside. To make the babas, place the flour, yeast, salt and sugar in a large free-standing mixer with a dough attachment and mix. Beat the eggs and milk together and gradually add to the dry ingredients. Beat in the butter.  Knead for 10 minutes and then place in a warm place to rise for a couple of hours. Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4 and preheat the grill. Knock the dough back and spoon into a piping bag with a plain nozzle. Sugar and flour four 11cm\/4½in baba tins (savarin moulds) and pipe the mixture into the moulds. Bake for 25 minutes. To make the syrup, place the sugar and hazelnut liqueur in a saucepan and heat to a syrup consistency. Leave to cool. Remove the babas from the oven and place in the syrup to soak up. Place the reserved plums on a baking tray, sprinkle with sugar and put under the grill to cook for 5-10 minutes.  To serve, arrange a line of plum purée on each of four bowls and place a baba in the centre. Pour more syrup over and place the ice cream in the centre. Put the warm plums around the edge of the plate.
