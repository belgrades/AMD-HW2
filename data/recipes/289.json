{"recipe_name":"Aubergine gratin with tomato sauce and salad","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the tomato sauce, heat a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the olive oil, tomatoes and garlic. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomatoes have just started to break down. Stir in the basil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Keep warm. For the aubergine, preheat the grill to its highest setting. Heat a frying pan over a medium to high heat. Season the aubergine slices with salt and freshly ground black pepper. When the pan is hot, add the oil and the aubergine slices, a few at a time. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until just golden-brown and softened. Remove the aubergine slices from the pan and arrange in a single layer on a plate or baking tray lined with kitchen paper, to drain. Scatter over the basil leaves, sultanas, pine nuts and the roughly chopped mozzarella. Roll each aubergine slice up from the short side, to form a pinwheel. Secure with a cocktail stick. Place the filled aubergine rolls into an ovenproof dish, wedging them in tightly. Remove the cocktail sticks and spoon over the tomato sauce.  Arrange the thin slices of mozzarella on top and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Grill for 3-4 minutes, or until the cheese is golden-brown and bubbling. For the salad, mix the rocket and parmesan shavings together in a bowl. Whisk the balsamic vinegar, olive oil and lemon juice together in a small bowl until well combined, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the rocket and parmesan to the dressing and mix well to combine.  To serve, spoon some of the filled aubergine rolls and tomato sauce onto serving plates and serve the salad alongside.
