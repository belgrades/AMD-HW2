Place a sugar thermometer into the pan and continue to cook until the temperature reads 128C\/260F, then plunge the base of the pan into cold water. Immediately pour the toffee into a cold heatproof glass bowl and whisk well. Add one tablespoon of cold water and whisk until the toffee has thickened, then pour onto a shallow baking tray lined with baking parchment. Allow to cool until firm. For the pavlova, preheat the oven to 140C\/285F\/Gas 1. Place the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Add 300g\/10Â½oz of the sugar, one tablespoonful at a time, whisking constantly, until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed and the mixture appears glossy and smooth. Add the cornflour and vinegar and whisk to combine. Cut the toffee into chunks. Add half of the toffee to the meringue mixture and fold in gently. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and spoon the meringue and toffee mixture onto the tray in a large round shape. Place into the oven to bake for ten minutes, then turn the oven off and leave for at least 2-3 hours (preferably overnight), until crisp but uncoloured. Remove from the oven and cool. Transfer to a serving plate. Place the remaining 150g\/5oz caster sugar and the water into a pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until it forms a caramel. Pour half of the caramel onto a baking tray lined with baking parchment and allow to cool. Keep the remaining caramel warm. Whisk the double cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Fold in the remaining toffee pieces, two thirds of the melted chocolate and almost all of the warm caramel. Spoon the cream, chocolate and caramel mixture into the centre of the meringue. Drizzle with the remaining melted chocolate and caramel. Break the cool, set caramel into shards and place in the centre of the pavlova. Serve immediately.
