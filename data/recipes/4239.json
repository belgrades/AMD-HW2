(CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Sprinkle the flour and breadcrumbs onto separate plates and beat the eggs in a bowl. Dredge the haddock strips in the flour, then dip in the egg and coat in the breadcrumbs. Deep-fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown. (You may need to do this in batches.) Remove from the fryer with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Add the potatoes to the deep-fat fryer and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Season with a little salt. For the tartare sauce, whisk the egg yolks and vinegar together in a bowl. Continue to whisk the mixture and slowly pour in the rapeseed oil until all of the oil is incorporated and mixture is thick and light. Stir in the capers, gherkins, shallot and herbs. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice.  To serve, pile the chips and goujons onto serving plates and spoon some tartare sauce alongside.
