(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the flour into a large mixing bowl and whisk in enough sparkling water to make a batter the consistency of double cream.  Dip the squid rings into the batter to coat, shake off any excess and carefully place into the hot oil. Deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper, then sprinkle with sea salt. For the citrus rice, place the hot rice into a large bowl and stir in the lime zest and juice and the coriander.  Lightly oil a ramekin, place the rice mixture into the ramekin and press down slightly.  To serve, turn the rice out onto a serving plate, top with the tempura squid and garnish with lime wedges and fresh coriander.
