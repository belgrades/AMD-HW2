Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Stir all of the ingredients, except the yoghurt, together in a bowl. Add most of the yoghurt and mix together to a soft dough. Add a little extra yoghurt if the dough is dry. Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead for a few minutes until smooth. Shape into round loaf and put on the baking tray. Flatten slightly with your hand then mark a deep X on the top using a knife. Make sure to cut almost all the way to the bottom of the dough, so that the middle of the bread cooks all the way through.  Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.
