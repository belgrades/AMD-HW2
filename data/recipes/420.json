Place the apple onto a microwave-proof plate and stuff the raisin mixture into the hole left by removing the core. Cook in the microwave on high for 3Â½ minutes, or until softened. For the custard, place the milk and cream into a saucepan and bring up to the boil. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Place the egg and egg yolk and the sugar into a bowl and mix well. Gradually pour the milk and cream over the egg mixture, then return the mixture to the pan over a gentle heat. Stir constantly until the custard starts to thicken. When it coats the back of a spoon, remove from the heat and pour through a sieve into a jug or bowl. To serve, place the baked apple onto a plate and pour over the custard.
