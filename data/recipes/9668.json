Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of cling film and bash with a meat mallet or rolling pin until thin. Remove the cling film, place the chicken breasts onto an oiled plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place into a steamer, cover and steam for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. (The juices will run clear when the chicken is pierced with a skewer in the thickest part.) Place the chopped coriander stalks, ginger, spring onions, crushed garlic, red chilli, soy sauce, rice vinegar and light brown sugar into a bowl and mix well. Place the three different oils into a pan on the hob and heat gently. Pour over the mixture in the bowl and mix to combine.  To serve, pile the cooked egg noodles into shallow serving bowls. Slice the cooked chicken and divide equally among the four bowls, spoon over the coriander and spring onion mixture and drizzle over the juices from the bowl.
