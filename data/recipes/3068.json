Repeat this process until all the lemons and salt are used up. Cover with the oils and seal the container. These can be used after three days and kept for up to a week. To make the paste, strain the lemons from the oil and reserve the oil. Put the lemons in a food processor and add the spices. Blend, adding enough oil as you go to make a paste. For the kebab, put a large, shallow pan over a medium heat. Add the oil and onion and sweat for 5 minutes. Add the pistachios and pine nuts and sauté for another 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 3 minutes. Add both types of mince, in batches, breaking up each batch with a wooden spoon and allowing it to cook for 3–4 minutes before you add the next batch. Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring, for 10–15 minutes. Stir in the spices and lemon paste and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. For the tapenade, put all the ingredients except the oil in a blender and blend. Gradually add the oil until you have the right consistency.  For the pesto, put all the ingredients in a blender and blend until combined.  For the tahigurt, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Divide between four plates.  Spoon the meat over the tahigurt. Spoon over the toppings and serve with the pittas.
