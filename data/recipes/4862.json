When hot, add the garlic and ginger cook for one minute, or until soft.  Add the prawns to the garlic and ginger, fry for one minute, tossing the wok or stirring the prawns with a spoon a couple of times. Season the scallops with salt and pepper. Lay the scallops round the edge of the hot wok, to get a little colour on the sides. Toss the wok or gently turn the seafood over, then add the rice wine. Add all the prepared vegetables and gently toss until the choi sum and pak choi have slightly wilted - this will take a further couple of minutes  Add the red chilli and light soy sauce, to taste.
