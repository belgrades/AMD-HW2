For the ‘roasted’ watermelon, fry the watermelon in a pan until coloured all over. For the soup, blend all the excess watermelon in a blender or food processor. In a pan, heat the sugar and 100ml\/3½fl oz water until the sugar dissolves. Leave to cool down. Stir in the mint, ground ginger and blended watermelon and put in the fridge to chill.
