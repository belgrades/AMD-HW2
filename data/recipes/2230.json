Press the mixture into the base of a chefs' ring on a serving plate. Place the whipped cream, mascarpone, honey and lemon juice into a large bowl and mix well. Place this mixture on top of the biscuit base, then place the cheesecake into the fridge to set. For the chocolate sauce, place the chocolate and cream into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water and heat, stirring frequently, until melted and combined to make a smooth sauce. Heat the sides of the chefs' ring with a mini-blowtorch to loosen the cheesecake and carefully slide the ring off. To serve, place the cherries and pistachios on top of the cheesecake and pour over the chocolate sauce.
