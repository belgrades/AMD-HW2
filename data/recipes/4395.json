Place the biscuits into a food bag and lightly bash with a rolling pin until they resemble breadcrumbs. Mix together the crushed biscuits and melted butter until well combined. Divide the mixture equally among four ramekins, pressing each portion down into an even layer at the base using your fingertips.  Divide the raspberries equally among the ramekins, putting them on top of the biscuit base.  Whisk together the cream cheese, beaten egg, vanilla extract and sugar until smooth and well combined. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the ramekins, smoothing the tops of each with a palette knife. Transfer the ramekins to a baking tray. Bake the cheesecakes in the oven for 18-20 minutes, or until the tops are light golden-brown and the cheese mixture is just set in the middle, with a slight wobble. To serve, place the ramekins onto dessert plates and garnish with fresh raspberries.
