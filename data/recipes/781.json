{"recipe_name":"Beetroot tartare with horseradish and beef","author":"Claus Meyer","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4 as a starter, or 2 as a main course","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the beetroot tartare, peel 100g\/3½oz of the beetroot and cut it into very small cubes. Put the beetroot cubes in a bowl with the vinegar. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to marinade.  Cook the remaining beetroot in a saucepan of boiling water for 40-45 minutes, until soft. Drain, submerge in cold water and remove their skins – you can wear plastic gloves if you don’t want your hands to be stained red.  Cut the cooked beetroots into very small cubes and toss them with red onion, apple, mustard and olive oil in a bowl. Add the raw marinated beetroot, to taste, along with the horseradish, honey and the foraged leaves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle with the rapeseed oil, to taste. For the smoked cheese, place the cheese in a bowl and mix in the cream and crème fraîche. Season with black pepper. To serve, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the breadcrumbs and fry until golden-brown. Dot the beef around the serving plates and place a small spoonful of the smoked cheese mix on top. Dot the beetroot mixture around the plates and garnish with the foraged leaves and toasted breadcrumbs.
