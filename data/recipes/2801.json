{"recipe_name":"Creamy chicken korma with almonds","author":"Madhur Jaffrey","programme":null,"prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/food\/ic\/food_16x9_608\/recipes\/creamychickenkormawi_90196_16x9.jpg","method":"Put the garlic, ginger and almonds into the bowl of a food processor. Turn on the food processor and pour six tablespoons of the water through the funnel and blend to a smooth paste (if your food processor doesn't have a funnel, just add the water before blending). Heat the oil in a wide pan set over a high heat. When it's very hot, add the bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves and cinnamon stick and stir for ten seconds (take care because they may spit when they hit the oil). Add the onion and cook for several minutes, stirring, until it's a medium-brown colour. Reduce the heat to medium-high once the onion begins to brown. Add the paste from the food processor and stir. Cook, stirring, for 3-4 minutes or until lightly browned. Add the cumin, coriander and chilli powder and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the tomato puree and stir for a minute longer. Add the salt, garam masala, cream and remaining water and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat them with the spice paste. Bring to a simmer, then cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer gently for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, turning the chicken pieces over several times during cooking. Transfer to a serving dish and serve with your choice of Indian breads and chutneys, rice or vegetables.
