Add the oil, when it’s warm, add the popcorn and cover.  Shake the pan when it starts to pop, don’t open it, it will take about 5 minutes for it all to pop but do keep shaking the pan. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with the salt.  For the coating, put all the ingredients except the bicarbonate of soda in a saucepan and bring to the boil. After 3 minutes it should be thick and golden, turn off the heat and now you have to work quickly, add the bicarbonate of soda and stir, it will puff up like honeycomb. Immediately pour over the hot popcorn and mix it through.  For the ice cream, put all the ingredients in and blender and blitz until you have a creamy paste. Keep cold until serving.  For the chocolate sauce, warm the cream in a pot then add the chocolate. Bring to the boil then remove from the heat. Give it a good stir.  Serve two scoops of the ice cream in a large cup or mug, scatter with the popcorn and pour over the hot chocolate sauce and spinkle on the popping candy.
