Discard the tough outer leaves of the fennel bulbs, reserving the green feathery tops for garnish. Slice the bulbs into thin wedges and reserve. Force the dark crabmeat through a sieve and add to a saucepan with 3-4 tablespoons of water.  Add the butter and place the mixture in a pan on a low heat to melt the butter and heat through. If the sauce is too thin, continue cooking until it reduces.  Meanwhile, put the fennel wedges and the pasta into the boiling water to cook.  Add the truffle oil to the crab sauce, and lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper.  Drain the fennel and pasta when it is al dente and return to the pan.  Pour in the crab sauce and the white crab meat. Toss to coat.  Serve with a sprinkling of the chopped fennel tops.
