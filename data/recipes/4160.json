Soak four wooden skewers in a bowl of water for about 20 minutes to prevent them from burning.  Shape the haggis mixture around the skewers and rub with the oil. Heat a griddle pan until hot and cook the koftas until browned on all sides and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. For the dressing, place all the dressing ingredients into a bowl and mix well. Serve the koftas on a plate with the dressing in a bowl on the side.
