{"recipe_name":"Pan-fried pork steak with aubergine, chorizo and fennel","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the aubergine, slice the aubergine and place on a roasting tray with the shallot and garlic. Drizzle with olive oil. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. For the pork, heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and season the pork steaks on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.   Add the butter to the frying pan with the oil and wait until it is a nutty brown colour.  Add the pork and cook quickly for about three minutes on each side until just cooked through. The juices will run clear when the meat is pierced with a skewer in the thickest point. For the fennel and chorizo, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil and blanch the fennel for two to three minutes until just tender, then drain. Heat a little olive oil in a pan, add the chorizo, olives and tomatoes and fry for two to three minutes. Add the garlic and blanched fennel and cook slowly for about two minutes. Add the basil and season to taste. Place a slice of aubergine in the middle of each plate, top with the pork steak and a spoonful of the fennel and chorizo mixture. Garnish with sprigs of fresh chervil.
