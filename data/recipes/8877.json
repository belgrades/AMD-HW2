Spray a bit of oil on two large baking trays and put two tortillas on each. Spray a little more on top of the tortillas and then rub the cut side of the garlic all over the tortillas - this gives the pizza extra flavour.  Divide the chopped tomatoes evenly between the 4 tortillas, spreading them out but leaving a 1.5cm\/¾in border. Scatter over the chilli flakes, if using, and divide the cheese and peppers evenly over the top.  Pop both trays into the oven to bake for about 4-6 minutes (depending on how hot your oven is), or until the cheese has melted and the tortillas are crisp and golden-brown on their edges. Swap the trays around on the shelves half way through for even cooking. Remove the tortillas from the oven and slide onto serving plates. Top with the rocket and basil (if using). Season with a little scattering of salt and pepper, then drizzle with balsamic vinegar and some extra virgin olive oil, if you fancy it.
