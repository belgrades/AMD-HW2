Cook over a low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring from time to time, until golden-brown, soft and sticky.  For the hotdogs, chop both fats then place in a food processor with the mince and all the other remaining ingredients, except the casings. Blend to a smooth paste. Fill a large piping bag with the hotdog mix and carefully fill the sheep casing. Twist the filled casings to separate into individual hotdogs, around 15cm\/6in long. Tie off the ends to seal in the mixture.  Place in a pan of cold water and bring up to 86C\/187F. The water must not exceed this temperature. Poach gently (so as not to break the casings) for about 10 minutes, or until the pork has cooked through. Drain well and serve in a brioche roll with mustard.
