Place the sprigs of thyme in between the Cumberland rings and place on a baking tray. Roast in the oven for 30-35 minutes, or until cooked through. Just before serving remove the thyme. Heat a medium saucepan of boiling water and blanch the lemon and orange zest three times, refreshing under cold water every time. Once the zest has softened, strain and leave to one side. Place the rest of the ingredients into a medium saucepan and whisk until glossy and thick. Season with salt and pepper and add the lemon and orange zest and simmer for five minutes. For the mash, boil the potatoes in salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and place the potatoes back into the saucepan over the heat to remove any excess moisture. Place the butter and cream into a saucepan and heat until the butter is melted. Add to the mash and beat well until soft and creamy. Finally season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, mix the oil, vinegar and mustard in a small glass bowl and dress the watercress. Place the sausage on a serving plate or shallow bowl, spoon the mash onto the plate and pour over the sauce. Garnish with the fresh watercress.
