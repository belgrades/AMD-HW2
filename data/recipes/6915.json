{"recipe_name":"Pistachio and fig steamed sponge pudding with pistachio ice cream","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pudding, sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Add the sugar, butter and eggs and beat well with an electric whisk for 2-4 minutes, or until a thick batter is formed. Add the pistachio nuts and fold into the batter well. Butter a 1.2litre\/2 pint ovenproof pudding basin and place the treacle and figs into the base of the bowl.  Pour the pudding mixture into the basin and level the top with a spatula. Cut a round of greaseproof paper to cover the bowl and place over the pudding. Make a pleat in the centre of a large round of kitchen foil and place this over the pudding. Pull the foil down the sides of the bowl and tie around the bowl with string. Trim off any excess foil all the way round. Place the basin into a large pan and fill with water to come two thirds of the way up the basin. Cover with a lid, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and steam for two hours. Check the water level halfway through and top up with more boiling water if the level has fallen. For the ice cream, place the cream, milk and caster sugar into a clean pan and bring to the boil. In a separate bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks for 1-2 minutes. Once the cream mixture has boiled, pour the mixture slowly onto the eggs, whisking constantly. Return the custard mixture to the pan and stir vigorously until the mixture has thickened. Remove from the heat, pass through a sieve into a bowl set in a large bowl of iced water and leave to cool. Meanwhile, place half of the pistachios and the rum into a food processor and blend to a fine paste. Stir the pistachio mixture into the custard mixture and fold in the remaining pistachios. Place the pistachio custard mixture into an ice cream machine and leave to run and set. To serve, place wedges of the pudding onto plates with a spoonful of ice cream served alongside.
