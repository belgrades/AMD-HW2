Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the pancetta and garlic for 2-3 minutes, until the pancetta is crisp and browned. Reduce the heat to low. In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs with the cream and most of the grated cheese, reserving a little cheese for the garnish. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.  Drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a few tablespoons of the cooking water.  Tip the spaghetti into the pan with the pancetta and pour in the cream and egg mixture. Mix well over a very low heat, adding a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen the mixture if needed.  Divide the pasta between two serving bowls and sprinkle with the remaining cheese and the chopped herbs. Serve immediately with the rocket salad on the side.
