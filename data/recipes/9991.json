Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured work surface, knead the poppy seeds in to one half of the dough and the parmesan and sun-dried tomato paste to the other. Using a rolling pin, roll out each piece of dough on a lightly floured work surface to about 3mm thick. Place each piece of dough on a baking tray, cover with cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C\/180C(fan)\/Gas 6.  Dust two large baking trays with flour.  Using a 7cm\/2¾cm round cutter cut out 18 rounds from each half of the dough, re-rolling as necessary. Place the rounds on the baking tray.  Brush the biscuits with beaten egg and sprinkle the parmesan and tomato ones with sesame seeds. Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cold.
