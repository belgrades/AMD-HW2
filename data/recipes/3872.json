Slice the mango flesh by cutting in a criss-cross pattern. Turn the mango inside out to create a 'hedgehog' effect with the cut flesh. Place the mango hedgehog on a baking sheet and sprinkle with the caster sugar, lime juice and dried chilli flakes. Place the mango under the hot grill and cook for eight minutes, or until the sugar turns golden. Meanwhile, for the topping, mix the Greek yoghurt with the orange zest in a bowl.
