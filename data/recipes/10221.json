Sift the chickpea flour with the salt into a bowl. Heat plenty of oil in a deep pan but do not let it get too hot. Gradually add the sifted flour to the onion mixture, rubbing it in with your fingers until firm and sticky. Add the water and mix well.  With your fingers, put small dollops (no bigger than 2.5cm\/1in) of the mixture into the oil to fry, just a few at a time or they will be soggy.  Fry them slowly until crisp and golden on the outside and cooked through in the centre - about 3-4 minutes. If the oil is too hot they will be raw and gooey inside. Drain in a sieve placed over a bowl and then serve immediately with Green Coconut Chutney (see separate recipe).
