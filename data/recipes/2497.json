Drain the rice and wash thoroughly. Line a bamboo steamer (with a lid)  with either greaseproof paper, a banana leaf or a clean sheet of muslin. If using greaseproof paper or a banana leaf, pierce some holes using a skewer (don’t make the holes too large, but you do want them to allow the steam through). Place about 425ml\/¾ pint of water (5cm\/2in depth) into a saucepan or a wok and place the rice in the steamer. Put on the lid, bring the water to the boil and then reduce the heat to low-medium and steam for about 20 minutes. In the meantime, add the coconut milk, salt, palm sugar and kaffir lime leaves to a saucepan. Warm through over a medium heat - do not boil.  Stir frequently for a good 5-7 minutes to infuse the flavours. Once infused, remove from the heat. Arrange the prepared papaya onto four plates or a suitable serving dish and pour over the zest and juice of the limes. Once the rice is cooked, put it into a mixing bowl and gradually add three-quarters of the infused coconut milk. Reserve the remaining quarter.   Mix well and leave to cool for 10-15 minutes. Transfer the rice into individual serving bowls or a suitable dish and drizzle over the remaining infused coconut milk. Serve the papaya salad along with the rice. Garnish with a sprig of mint if liked.
