In a large serving dish mix together the onion, mayonnaise, chutney and half the mint and half of the parsley. Mix well and season with salt and pepper to taste. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice them in half. Depending on the size of potatoes, I like to cut some into halves and some into quarters rather than all uniform size. Mix the potatoes into the mayonnaise and onion mix. Stir well and sprinkle over the remaining mint and parsley. Check for seasoning and get stuck in!
