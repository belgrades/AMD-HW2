{"recipe_name":"Smoked mackerel fishcakes","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Mix the mashed potato, smoked mackerel, parsley and horseradish cream together in a bowl and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Mould the mixture into six equal-sized fishcakes. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes. Remove the fishcakes from the fridge and dredge in flour, then dip into beaten egg to completely coat, then dip into the polenta to completely cover. Heat the oil in a deep frying pan until hot, but not smoking, and shallow-fry the fishcakes for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden-brown all over and cooked through. (If the fishcakes are browning too much but not hot in the middle, place onto a baking tray and bake for 5-6 minutes in an oven preheated to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6.) For the salad, combine the mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice in a bowl. Add the carrots, edamame beans, green beans and chickpeas and mix well.  To serve, place a spoonful of salad onto each plate and top with a hot fishcake.
