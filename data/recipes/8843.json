Marinade for 24 hours in the fridge. For the honey mustard vinaigrette, in a food processor, blend the spring onions, mustard, pickled ginger, lime juice, garlic, shallots, honey, soy sauce and ginger vinegar to a smooth paste. With the motor running, slowly add the oils in a thin steady stream until emulsified. For the Asian cabbage salad, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Remove from the fridge and wipe off the marinade. Allow the steak to come up to room temperature. When you are ready to cook the steak, heat a griddle pan until hot. Add the steak and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Allow to rest for a few minutes before serving. To serve, gently toss the salad in the vinaigrette. Slice the steak and serve with the dressed salad.
