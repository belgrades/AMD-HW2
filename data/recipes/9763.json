For the steak, season the meat with salt and freshly ground black pepper and rub in the oil. Heat a griddle pan until smoking, then sear the steak on both sides for 1-2 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Place the Stilton slices on top and transfer to the oven for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Remove the steak from the pan and allow to rest on a warm plate. Return the pan to the heat and deglaze with the red wine, simmering for 4-5 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by about a third.  For the pea purée, heat the olive oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the peas and stock, and simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until the peas are tender. Stir in the mint and cream and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using a stick blender, process until smooth. For the carrots, melt the butter in a pan and add the carrots and honey. Place over a low heat, cover with a lid and simmer for about 8-10 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Stir in the coriander. To serve, spoon the pea purée onto a serving plate. Thickly slice the steak and lay on top of the purée, and place the carrots to the side. Spoon the red wine sauce around the edges of the plate and serve.
