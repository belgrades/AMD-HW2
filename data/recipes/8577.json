Make a generous bed of sea salt on a baking sheet. Remove the scallops from their shells and remove any tough sinew with a sharp knife. Clean the shells, then place one half of each shell onto the bed of sea salt on the tray, to keep them upright, and top with the scallops. Scatter the cherry tomato halves and the chopped leek over the scallops in their shells. In a pan, heat the butter, white wine and lime juice together until the butter has melted and the mixture is well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour this mixture over the scallops. Transfer to the oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the scallops are cooked through. Remove from the oven and drizzle over the sesame oil. Place onto a serving plate, garnish with lemon wedges and serve immediately.
