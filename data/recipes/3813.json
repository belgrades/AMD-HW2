Place a wide layer of cling film on a baking tray and spread half the cure mixture onto it. Place the salmon fillet skin-side down on top of the cure and spoon the rest over the top. Cover it evenly, pressing the mixture into the flesh of the salmon. Wrap the entire bundle tightly in more cling film and weigh it down with another baking tray or a chopping board, with a weight set on it. Put the whole lot in the fridge for 48 hours, turning the fish bundle every 12 hours. After two days, take the fish out of the cling film and rinse the cure off the surface under cold running water. Dry the fish all over with kitchen paper or a tea towel. To serve, slice the gravlax thinly along its side, or in more chunky, vertical cuts.
