Place half of the oats into the ring, then top with half the raspberries.  Place the cream cheese, cream and sugar into a bowl and mix well. Spoon this mixture on top of the raspberries, then top with the remaining oats and the grated chocolate.  Heat the outside of the chefs' ring with a mini-blowtorch to loosen it, then carefully slide it off. Place the remaining raspberries on top of the cheesecake and garnish with a sprig of mint. For the chocolate sauce, place all the chocolate sauce ingredients into a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring until the chocolate has melted and the sauce has thickened. To serve, drizzle the chocolate sauce over the cheesecake.
