{"recipe_name":"Light summer broth with a herb dressing","author":"Mark Sargeant","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the light summer broth, place the chicken in a large pan with the thyme, bay leaves and stock cube and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and skim off any scum that rises to the surface, then season with sea salt. Place the potatoes and mint in a large saucepan with water and bring to the boil. Cook for 10-15 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain. Set aside. Simmer the chicken for about 20 minutes, then add the courgettes, peas, broad beans and French beans. Bring back to the simmer and cook for 6-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. For the herb dressing, place all the ingredients apart from the olive oil into a blender, then blend for a minute or so just to break it down a bit. Pour in the oil and then blend again, this time until you have a smooth, bright green sauce. To serve, divide the potatoes between four warm bowls. Each portion should have a drum stick and piece of thigh, plenty of bright green vegetables and some chicken broth. Spoon over some of the herb dressing and serve with the Jersey Royal potatoes dressed in a little of the dressing. Reserve any remaining dressing in a jar to use as you wish. Garnish the soup with shavings of asparagus (shaved lengthways and dressed in olive oil) and pea shoots.
