Add the venison loin and fry, turning regularly, for 10-12 minutes, until browned all over but still pink inside. Set the meat aside to rest. For the salad dressing, heat a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Melt the butter, then drain the oil form the anchovies and add the anchovies to the melted butter. Continue to cook until the butter has melted and the anchovies have collapsed. Add the Worcestershire sauce, walnut-pickling juice and brown sugar. Stir well and continue to cook until the mixture reduces to a syrupy consistency. Stir in the walnut oil until well combined, then season, to taste, with freshly ground black pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve. Meanwhile, for the salad, in a large bowl, mix together the radishes, chervil and pea shoots, then drizzle over the walnut oil and lemon juice, stirring well to combine. Season to taste with salt. Once the venison has rested, carve into slices. To serve, arrange a few of the beetroot and gherkin slices onto each of four serving plates. Sprinkle over the chopped pickled walnuts. Arrange the venison slices on top. Heap the pea shoot and radish salad on top of the meat. Drizzle over the warm salad dressing.
