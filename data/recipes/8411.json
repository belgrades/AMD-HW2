Rinse the salt cod, put it in a saucepan, cover with the milk and bring to the boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, boil the potatoes for 15–20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and cool a little before slipping off the skins, then mash until fluffy. Remove the cod from the milk and leave to cool. Remove any skin and bones and put the fish in a food processor. Add the oil, onion and garlic and pulse to a paste.  Put the paste in a large bowl and mix with the mashed potato, herbs, pepper and egg. The mixture should be quite stiff. Shape the mixture into rugby-ball shapes and set aside, you can do this with your hands or using two dessertspoons to quenelle the mixture.  Heat the sunflower oil in a large, heavy pan to 165C, using a temperature probe or sugar thermometer to check (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not over-fill the pan or leave unattended). Fry the fritters in small batches for 2–3 minutes, until rich golden-brown. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and olives.
