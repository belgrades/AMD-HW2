Place over a medium heat, bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 1-1½ hours, or until the beans are tender, topping up with water if the pot starts to look dry.  Heat the oil in a large pan or karahi over a medium heat and fry the onions, garlic and ginger for 10 minutes or until tinged golden-brown. Add the salt, chilli powder and garam masala and fry for 30 seconds, then stir in the yogurt and cook for five minutes. Add the drained cooked beans to the onion mixture, along with enough of the cooking liquid to just cover the beans (topping up with water if necessary) and simmer for 10 minutes, mashing a few beans against the side of the pan with the back of a spoon to thicken the gravy. Serve with basmati rice and wedges of lime.
