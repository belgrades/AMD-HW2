{"recipe_name":"Sugar-free queen of puddings","author":"Lesley Waters","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Gently heat the cream, vanilla extract and 1-2 tablespoons of sugar-substitute in a saucepan, stirring all the time so the sugar-substitute dissolves but the mixture does not boil.  Crack the two eggs and one yolk into a heatproof bowl and whisk. Stir the breadcrumbs into the warm cream mixture. Gently pour the cream mixture onto the eggs, whisking all the time.  Pour the mixture into four heatproof ramekins. Place the ramekins into a deep roasting tray and fill the tray with water until it reaches halfway up the side of the ramekins (this is called a bain-marie). Transfer to the oven and bake for ten minutes or until the puddings are set. For the coulis, place the berries and sugar-substitute into a pan and gently heat, stirring so the sugar-substitute dissolves and the fruit softens. After five minutes, take off the heat and blend with a stick blender. Pass through a sieve into a clean pan. Set aside. For the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until they form soft peaks. Add one tablespoon of sugar-substitute and whisk again for one minute, then add the other tablespoon of sugar-substitute. Whisk until the meringue is glossy. When the puddings are cooked, spoon a layer of the coulis over the puddings then pipe or spoon the meringue on top. Return to the oven for 5-6 minutes or until the meringue begins to turn brown. Serve hot.
