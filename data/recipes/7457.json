To make the guacamole, mash the avocados with the lime juice. Add the garlic, onion, tomato, chilli and coriander and mix thoroughly to combine. To make the quesadillas, heat a chargrill pan over a medium to high heat, add the courgette slices and peppers and grill for 10-15 minutes or until softened and chargrilled in places. Remove the griddled vegetables from the pan and cut into strips. Spread one tablespoon each of guacamole and salsa onto four tortillas.  Divide the vegetables between the four tortillas. Wrap them up and return them to the chargrill pan for one minute on each side. Open the quesadilla slightly to serve, garnished with coriander leaves and wedge of lime.
