In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients together.  Rub in butter and lard so that mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add just enough cold water to bring the mixture together to form a stiff dough (about 5-6 tablespoons). Refrigerate for 15-20 minutes. On a lightly floured worksurface, roll out the dough to a thickness just less than a £1 coin. Using a 9cm\/3½in round cutter cut out biscuits from the dough. Prick the top of the biscuits all over to decorate, leaving a plain 5mm\/¼in border around the edge. Transfer to wire racks or baking mesh. Place the racks\/mesh on baking trays and bake for 14-16 minutes, or until the biscuits are dry but not browned. Set aside to cool completely. Serve the biscuits with chilled butter.
