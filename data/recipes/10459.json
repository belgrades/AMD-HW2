Place the dates, bicarbonate of soda and enough water to cover the dates into a saucepan over a low heat and cook very slowly, stirring occasionally, until the dates break down and form a sticky sauce. Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl and add the sugar. Rub the butter into the flour mixture and then add the egg and mix together. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly, until a smooth dough forms. Add the date mixture to the dough and mix together well. On a clean, flat, floured surface, roll out the dough to 2.5cm\/1in thick, then, using a pastry cutter, cut into 7.5cm\/3in rounds. Place the rounds of dough onto a greased baking tray and transfer to the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until risen and golden. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. To serve, cut the scones in half. Mix the lemon curd and banana together in a clean bowl, then spread generously onto one half of each the scones. Top with clotted cream, place the scone tops on top and arrange on a large serving plate.
