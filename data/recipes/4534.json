For the honey sesame seed chicken, heat an ovenproof chargrill pan over a medium heat. Mix the olive oil, cayenne pepper and seasoning in a bowl, and coat the chicken with the mixture. Fry the chicken for 3-4 minutes in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat, or until crisp and golden-brown. Drizzle the honey over the chicken and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.) Remove the chicken from the oven and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.  For the chilli and parsley rice, heat one tablespoon of the oil in a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the chilli, parsley and rice for 4-5 minutes, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, brush the insides of a teacup or similar with the remaining oil. Spoon the chilli and parsley rice mixture into the cup, press the rice down so that the rice moulds to the cup, then turn the rice out onto a plate. Place the honey and sesame seed chicken on top of the rice, and garnish with the fresh chives.
