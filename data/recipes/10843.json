Break the chocolate into pieces and drop into a food processor.  Blend for one minute or until just a few pieces remain in the otherwise powdery chocolate. Alternatively finely grate the chocolate. Measure the sugar into a small pan with 90ml\/3fl oz of water and heat gently over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved, stirring occasionally.  Turn up the heat and boil briskly for 3-4 minutes, or until it becomes a thin syrup.  Set the processor running and pour in the hot syrup through the funnel onto the chocolate so that it melts and becomes liquid. Add just a little more boiling water if some unmelted chocolate remains.  Add the egg yolks and process for a few seconds before adding the brandy. If you are not using a processor, beat the ingredients together. In a separate bowl, beat the cream to a soft floppy consistency, then fold in the chocolate mixture. Spread in the prepared tin, levelling the top with the back of a spoon, then cover with cling film and transfer to the freezer for a minimum of four hours to freeze. To serve, remove from the freezer, release from tin and transfer to a plate. Allow to soften a little and serve about 20 minutes after coming out of the freezer. Decorate with the strawberries and icing sugar and serve with a little cream.
