For the crumble, in a bowl, rub together all the crumble ingredients, using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the crumble mixture on top of the filling mixture in an even layer.  Bake the crumble in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crumble is crisp and golden-brown.  Meanwhile, for the topping, blend the olive oil, basil and lemon juice in a food processor until well combined.  To serve, divide the butternut squash crumble equally among four serving plates.
