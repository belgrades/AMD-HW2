Bring a small saucepan of water to the boil, add the rinds and cook for 20 seconds. Strain and boil again in fresh water. For the third boil, add the sugar to 100ml\/3½fl oz water and heat gently until dissolved. Return the rind to the pan. Once the liquid has reduced to a syrup remove from the heat. Carefully remove the rind (boiling sugar gets very hot) and set aside to cool.  Mix the curd with the whipped cream. Top the pavlovas with the whipped cream mixture and some candied peel.
