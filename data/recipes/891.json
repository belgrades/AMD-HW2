{"recipe_name":"Black pudding-stuffed lamb with minted broad beans","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the lamb, place the lamb onto a board, skin-side down. Place the black pudding along the length of the lamb fillet, then wrap the skin over the top, to form a roll. Secure the stuffed lamb at intervals with kitchen string. Heat an ovenproof frying pan until hot, then add half of the olive oil and the stuffed lamb. Fry for one minute on all sides, until browned all over. Turn the lamb skin-side up and roast in the oven for 18-20 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the oven and rest for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot. Add the remaining olive oil and the mini black puddings and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until browned all over and completely cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside. For the broad beans, heat a separate pan until hot, then add the butter and the broad beans and fry for two minutes, stirring regularly. Add the cream and mint and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 2-3 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mash lightly with a fork. For the sauce, place the red wine into a separate pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the stock and continue to simmer until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the butter and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, slice the stuffed lamb into 12 slices of equal thickness. Spoon the minted broad bean mixture into the centre of each plate and top each portion with three slices of the stuffed lamb. Crumble the mini black puddings, then sprinkle around the edge of each plate. Spoon the red wine sauce over the stuffed lamb and around the plate.
