Refresh in iced water and drain well. Take half of the chives and place in a sieve, then run hot water over them for a few seconds until wilted.  Drain well and dry on paper towels. Take 3-4 spears of asparagus and tie together using the blanched chives.The chives should be about 4cm from the tip of the asparagus, and the bundles should be trimmed to a length of 5-6 cm. Do not trim the asparagus before you tie it as the short spears will be difficult to handle. Arrange the bundles on a plate. For the dip: combine the créme fraïche and truffle oil and season well.  Finely chop the remaining chives and add to the mixture.   Transfer the dip into a serving bowl and serve with the bundles.
