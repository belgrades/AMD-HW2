{"recipe_name":"Sweetcorn fritters with crispy bacon and tomatoes","author":"John Torode","programme":"Great British Budget Menu","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Put the sweetcorn and chilli flakes into a mixing bowl. Sift in the flour and baking powder and mix.  In a separate small bowl or jug, combine the eggs and milk and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.  Pour over the sweetcorn and flour, and mix well so that everything is evenly distributed.  Preheat the oven to 160C\/325F\/Gas 3. Fry the bacon in a large dry frying pan over a medium heat until crisp and coloured. Once cooked remove and set to one side. If there are any burnt bits in the frying pan remove these.  Add some olive oil to the pan and then add tablespoon sized dollops of the sweetcorn batter to the pan (you will need to fry these in batches). Fry over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until coloured, then turn and repeat on the other side. Keep warm in the preheated oven while you cook the remaining batter. Add a little more oil to the pan as you go to prevent the fritters sticking and to help them colour nicely. Meanwhile season the finely diced tomato with salt and pepper. Serve the crisp sweetcorn fritters with the bacon and the chopped tomato sprinkled over the top.
