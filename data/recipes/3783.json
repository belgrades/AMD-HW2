Place the ham in the oven and roast for eight minutes until crisp. Allow the ham to cool - it will harden slightly. Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan and add the garlic. Add the croissant halves to the pan and fry until a deeper golden-brown on both sides. For the poached eggs, bring a small saucepan of water and the vinegar to a simmer over a medium heat. Carefully crack the eggs into two small ramekins, being careful not to break the yolks. Gently add the eggs to the water. Turn down the heat and place a lid on the pan. Cook the eggs for two minutes until the white is firm. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and press the base of the spoon against a sheet of kitchen paper to drain.  To serve, place the ham and fried croissant on a plate and arrange the egg on top. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
