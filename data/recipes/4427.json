Pass through a fine sieve. Place back on the heat in a new saucepan and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and add the lemon juice. Do not whisk. The milk infusion will split on its own.  Remove from the heat, set aside for 30 minutes. Place a sieve over a large bowl and line with muslin. Pour the split milk mixture into the sieve and place in the fridge for 6 hours. Discard the whey and place the curd in the fridge. For the broad bean salad, heat a large saucepan of boiling water and season with salt. Blanch the peas, broad beans and asparagus for 3-5 minutes, plunge in cold water to cool then drain. Mix the vegetables in a bowl, then add the fennel and pea shoots.  For the dressing, place the ingredients into a bowl and whisk to combine. Pour the dressing over the salad and mix just before serving. To serve, spoon ricotta onto a plate, dress with some black pepper, sea salt and extra virgin olive oil and place some of the salad alongside.
