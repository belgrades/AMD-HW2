Bring the stew to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.  Add the broad beans and cook for a further minute.

Heat a frying pan until hot, add the remaining olive oil and fry the gurnard fillets, skin side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until just crisp. Flip the fillets over and continue to cook for another two minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Remove the gurnard from the pan and set aside to rest for 1-2 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a separate frying pan and  fry the bacon lardons for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.
