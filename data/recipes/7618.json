Rinse and squeeze dry – you should be left with 200g\/7oz cabbage – then put it in a large heatproof bowl. Put the sugar, vinegars, mirin, star anise, ginger, garlic and 1 heaped teaspoon salt in a saucepan and slowly bring to the boil. Cook, stirring, until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Pour the hot mixture over the cabbage, stir well and leave to cool.  Spoon the cabbage and its liquid into a sterilised jar, seal and label. Set aside for at least a day, or up to a week. When you are ready to eat, make the Gentleman’s Relish mayonnaise. Spoon the mayonnaise into a bowl, add a teaspoon of the Gentleman’s Relish and taste. Keep adding the relish like this and tasting until you have a savoury, slightly salty mixture. Season with the lemon juice. For the cabbage, put the pickled cabbage in a bowl. Blanch the chillies, then dunk them in iced water twice and drain before adding them to the bowl. Add the chervil, blanched chillies, rehydrated seaweed and brown shrimps and season with salt. Taste and mix in olive oil, lemon and lime juice to taste.  Put the sliced scallops on a clean stainless steel or plastic tray and sprinkle with the lime zest.
