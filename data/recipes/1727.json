Set aside to cool slightly. Put the cherries in a large pan with 50ml\/2fl oz of the sugar syrup and half the cherry brandy. Cook for 5-10 minutes, then set aside to cool.  Whisk together half the cream and all the custard.  Soak the cake slices in the remaining brandy and 50ml\/2fl oz sugar syrup. In a large serving bowl, create the layers. First add the cherries, then the soaked cake and top with the cream and custard mixture. Put the remaining whipped cream in a piping bag and pipe swirls onto the top of the trifle. Cover with the grated chocolate. To decorate, melt the sugar into a non-stick pan set over a medium heat. Keep heating until a dark-brown caramel forms (CAUTION: Do not leave unattended), then immediately dunk the pan in cold water to prevent the caramel burning.  Carefully dip the cherries into the caramel and place on a silicone mat or non-stick baking parchment to cool completely. When cool decorate the trifle with them.
