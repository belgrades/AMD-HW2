(CAUTION: Hot oil is very dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Place the flour and spices into a bowl season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well.  Place the tofu into the spice mix and coat the tofu cubes. Carefully lower the tofu into the hot oil and deep-fry until crisp and golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the mushrooms, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the garlic, mango, half of the chilli and the sliced mushrooms. Mix well and cook for one minute.  Add the soy sauce, lime juice and sesame oil and cook for another minute. Add the spinach, stir well and season with salt and black pepper. To serve, place the mushroom mixture onto a serving plate and top with the tofu. Garnish with the sliced chilli.
