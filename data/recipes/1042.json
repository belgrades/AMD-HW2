For the scallops, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the scallops for 1 minute, then carefully turn the scallops over and fry for 30 seconds. Remove the scallops from the pan and season to taste, with lemon juice and salt.  Add the chicken wings to the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes or until the skin is crisp.
