Whisk together until combined. In a non-stick frying pan, melt the butter until it begins to foam, then add the egg mixture. Cook the eggs without stirring, until just beginning to set, then push the egg gently towards the centre of the pan with a spatula. Continue doing this until the egg mixture has just set then turn the mixture over and remove from the heat. Place the roasted red peppers, chopped Peppadew peppers and spinach into a bowl and mix well. To serve, place a warmed tortilla onto each plate. Line the edge of each tortilla with the grated cheese and top with the pepper and spinach mixture. Add one or two spoonfuls of the eggs, then roll up the tortillas like cigars. Serve with a hot pepper sauce of your choice.
