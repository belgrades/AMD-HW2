Slice the aubergines then fry them on both sides in a large pan with a little olive oil. Drain on kitchen paper.

Add a good pinch of cumin and cinnamon with the wine and saut√© together to break up the tomatoes. Add the chopped mint and the stock in stages. In an ovenproof dish, layer the aubergines and lamb mince in a few layers, finishing with a layer of aubergines. Combine the white sauce with the eggs, nutmeg and seasoning.
