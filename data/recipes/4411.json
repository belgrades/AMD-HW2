(The mustard seeds will soften and soak up most of the beer.) Sterilise the jars for the mustard.  Wash in very hot water or on the hot cycle of a dishwasher.  Preheat the oven to 160C\/325F\/Gas 3. Place the jars upside down on a baking tray and dry in the oven for 10-15 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients, then blend in a food processor until nearly smooth (you may need to do this is batches). Spoon the mustard into the sterilised jars; tap gently to remove all the air bubbles.
