Add the mint leaves and bring the liquid back to the boil.  Add the peas and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the peas are just tender and bright green. Strain the mint and peas, reserving the cooking liquid, and transfer the peas and mint to a food processor. Allow to cool for 3-4 minutes.  Add just enough of the cooking liquid to cover the peas and mint, then blend for 1-2 minutes, to create a smooth, bright green purée. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add a generous drizzle of olive oil.  Add 140ml\/4½fl oz of the crème fraîche to the pea and mint purée and pulse in the blender for a few seconds, until combined. To serve, pour equal amounts of the soup into four warmed bowls. Add a neat tablespoon of crème fraîche into the centre of each and, if you wish, garnish with the crisp Parma ham.
