For the pastry place the plain flour, butter, egg, seasoning and walnuts into a food processor and pulse until combined into a dough. Add a splash or two of milk if necessary to bring the dough together. Remove and roll the dough into a ball, then cover with cling film and place into the fridge to chill for two hours. Remove the dough from the fridge and cling film. Roll out on a clean floured surface to 2cm\/1in thickness and cut out a round using a 15cm\/6in plate as a guide. For the filling, place the new potatoes, cheese, spinach and red onions into a bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well.  Now place the potato mixture onto one half of the pastry. Fold over the other half to cover, crimp the edges to seal and brush with the egg wash. Place onto a baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for 20 minutes, or until crisp and golden. For the chutney, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, chilli and ginger and fry until soft.  Add the carrot and cook for ten minutes. Add the ginger wine and boil to reduce, until nearly all of the liquid has evaporated. Add the sugar, vinegar, cloves and cinnamon and simmer for 15-25 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the mixture is thickened. To serve, place the pasty on a plate with the chutney spooned alongside.
