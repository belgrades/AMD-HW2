Peel a few strips lengthways from the aubergines, so you can get the flesh out of the aubergine. Cut an incision and scoop out the flesh and set aside.  Heat olive oil in a pan and sauté the onion, garlic, fennel and celery until softened. Add the sausage and cook for 20 minutes. Chop the aubergine flesh and add to the pan. Add the breadcrumbs to the pan then the pine nuts. Tip the mixture into a bowl then add the capers, egg, oregano, cheese and currants. Mix well and season with salt and pepper.  Stuff the aubergines with the mixture and place into a deep baking tray, oil well and add 150ml\/5fl oz water to the baking tray. Cover loosely with foil and bake for 40 minutes. This will help steam and cook the aubergine. Remove the foil and bake for a further 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the sun-dried tomatoes with the remaining olive oil and the fresh oregano. To serve, spoon the sun-dried tomatoes over the aubergine.
