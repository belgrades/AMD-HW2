For the soufflé, blanch the peas in a saucepan of boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes. Drain and transfer to a food processor. Add the double cream, mustard, egg yolks, cheese and chives and blend until smooth. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Lightly grease a small ovenproof dish or pan with butter and dust with flour. In a clean, grease-free bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Stir one third of the egg white into the pea mixture to loosen it, then gently fold the remaining egg white into the pea mixture until well combined. Spoon into the prepared dish, transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until well risen and golden-brown. For the creamed peas, blanch the peas in a saucepan of boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes, then drain and return to the pan. Stir in the double cream and curry powder, then use a mini-blender to blend the mixture until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, serve the soufflé in the dish and drizzle over the creamed peas.
