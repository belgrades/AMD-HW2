Pour the mixture into a large frying pan or wok and bring to the boil. Add the carrot batons and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender. Heat the vegetable oil in a separate frying pan, add the pak choi and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side. Place the pak choi pieces into two serving bowls and pour over the broth. Meanwhile, for the crisp fried noodles, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the blanched noodles into the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To serve, place the crisp noodles on top of the broth in each bowl and garnish with coriander.
