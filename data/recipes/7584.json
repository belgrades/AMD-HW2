To make the base and topping of the pudding, use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour. Stir in the sugar. Place half the mixture in the bottom of the tin and press it down firmly with your knuckles. Place all the fruit evenly on top of the firm base. Pour the remaining mixture over the fruit and again press down to firm. Bake for 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and further compress the pudding by placing a plate or pan on top filled with weights. A couple of tins would do the trick. Set aside to cool. When cooled, remove the pudding from the tin and dust with icing sugar. Serve with fresh raspberries and double cream.
