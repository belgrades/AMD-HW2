Mix the onions, garlic and celery in the oil to coat them, season with black pepper and roast for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and add the tomatoes, sugar, vinegar, cannellini beans and sage and cook for a further 20 minutes at 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.  For the dressing, whisk together all the ingredients in a small bowl. Mix the dressing with the bean mixture.  For the creamy garlic scallop potatoes, preheat the oven to 170C\/340F\/Gas 3½. Place the cream, milk, garlic, nutmeg in a pan and season well with salt and pepper. Heat gently until just boiling.  Meanwhile, layer up the potatoes in a lightly buttered medium size shallow ovenproof dish. Pour over the hot cream mixture. Cover with foil and cook in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the potatoes are soft. Remove the foil and cook for a further 30-40 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling. For the pork medallions, slice the pork fillet on a slant into eight pieces. Using the palm of your hand, gently flatten the pieces of pork into medallion shapes. Using a small, sharp knife, cut two slits into the centre of each medallion. Pull a small fig and sage leaf through each cut. Season with pepper.  Heat a non-stick frying pan with the butter and oil. When foaming, lay in the stuffed pork medallions. Cook over a medium heat for 2 -3 minutes each side, then set aside and keep warm. Pour in the masala, stirring as it boils and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced and thickened to a sauce consistency.  To serve, spoon the cannellini beans onto serving plates. Arrange the pork medallions on top and drizzle the marsala juices around. Serve the creamed potatoes alongside.
