Grease 4 dariole (circular) moulds with butter. For the fondants, melt the butter and chocolate in a bowl over a bain-marie, making sure the bowl doesn't touch the water. Leave to cool for 1 minute. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and sugar until they have doubled in size and are pale in colour. Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the egg mixture (if you do this when it is too hot it will scramble the eggs). Sift in the flour, then carefully fold it in. Quarter-fill the dariole moulds with the chocolate mixture. Drop a chocolate in each pot, then spoon the remaining chocolate mixture over the top, leaving a gap as they will rise. Bake for 5–6 minutes. Meanwhile, for the caramel sauce, melt the butter in a medium saucepan and add the sugar. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Add the cream and cook until you have a thick, glossy sauce. For the chocolate sauce, bring 100ml\/3½fl oz water to the boil in a medium saucepan. Add the chocolate and whisk until smooth. Add the butter and whisk to combine. Drizzle the caramel and chocolate sauces around the fondants on individual dessert plates. Serve with the ice cream and chocolate mint.
