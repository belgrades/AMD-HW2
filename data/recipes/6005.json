Turn down the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender. Drain and set aside. Heat one tablespoon of oil in two heavy-based frying pans set over a medium heat. Divide the onion between the two pans and fry gently for 10 minutes, or until soft and golden-brown. Add half the nduja and chilli to each pan and cook for three minutes. Stir in equal amounts of the Serrano ham, cook for a further three minutes. Add half the potatoes, capers and butter to each pan. Let the potatoes brown - keep turning them every so often with a spatula until crisp all over. Make two holes in the mixture in each pan. Crack two eggs in each hole, cover with a lid and cook for three minutes until set. Meanwhile, toast the bread on a griddle pan until crisp. Spoon the hash onto four plates, giving each person two eggs, and sprinkle over the parsley.  Serve with the toast and chilli sauce on the side.
