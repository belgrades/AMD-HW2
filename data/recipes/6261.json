De-glaze the pan with the vermouth and cook until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half. Add the fish stock and cream and cook again until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half.  Blend the mixture in a blender and pass the sauce through a sieve. For the pan-fried cod with a parsley crust, preheat the grill to the highest setting. Blend the breadcrumbs, parsley and four tablespoons of the olive oil in a food processer  until well combined.  Roll the mixture out on a work surface and cut out four pieces the same size as the cod fillets. Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and fry the cod, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes. Remove the cod fillets from the pan, peel off the skin and place the parsley crust on top.  Grill the cod fillets for 2-3 minutes. For the sautéed girolles, melt the butter in a frying pan, fry the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes, then stir in the chopped parsley. To serve, spoon the mushrooms around each of four serving plates, place a cod fillet into the centre of each plate and spoon around the vermouth sauce.
