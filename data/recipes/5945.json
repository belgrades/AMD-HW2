Heat a large saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the mussels, thyme and wine and place a lid on. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the mussels have opened. Drain, reserving the cooking liquor, and discard any mussels that remain closed. Pick the mussels from their shells. Set aside the liquor and the mussels. Heat a large frying pan and add the butter and oil. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for two minutes. Add the leeks and fennel and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Stir in the sweetcorn, then add the stock, retained liquor and three-quarters of the mussel meat. Cook for 2-3 minutes.  Place the soup in a blender and blend until smooth. Pour back into the pan and stir in the cream. Toast the bread. Drop the tomatoes into a bowl of boiling water for two minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon and refresh in iced water. Peel and de-seed the tomatoes, then dice the flesh. Transfer it to a small bowl and mix in the dill, olive oil and remaining mussels.  Serve the soup with the toast and tomato mixture.
