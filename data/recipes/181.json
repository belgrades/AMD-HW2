Grease a 20cm\/8in square cake tin with butter, then line the base and sides with baking parchment. Slowly bring the butter and syrup to the boil in a saucepan, stirring. Remove from the heat and stir in the oats and salt, then the dried apricots, until well combined. Scrape the mixture into the prepared tin, then press it into an even layer using the back of a wooden spoon. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden-brown. Set aside to cool slightly in the tin, then run a round-bladed knife around the inside edges of the tin and cut the flapjack into squares. Set them aside to cool completely in the tin. Meanwhile, suspend a heatproof glass bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl does not touch the water. Add the chocolate and stir until melted.  Turn the cooled flapjacks out onto a wire rack and drizzle them with the melted chocolate. Set aside for a further 25-30 minutes, or until the chocolate has set. Enjoy!
