For the scones, place the flour, sugar and baking powder into a food processor and pulse to combine. With the motor running, pour in the milk and melted butter, adding more milk if necessary to bring together into a ball of dough.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and shape into a ball. Flatten the ball slightly, and cut into wedges. Heat the remaining butter in an ovenproof frying pan, add the scone wedges and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until starting to colour. Transfer to the oven to cook for 6-8 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown. For the sauce, place all of the jam ingredients into a pan and cook 6-7 minutes, or until the apples are very tender. Mash with a fork.  Serve the scones on a board alongside a dish of the apple sauce and clotted cream.
