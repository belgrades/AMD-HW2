Thread the beef onto skewers that have been soaked in water. Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the skewers and brown them on all sides for 1-2 minutes.  For the noodles, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Carefully drop in the noodles and cook for two minutes, or until puffed up and crisp. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To serve, pile the noodles onto a serving plate, top with the beef satay kebabs and sprinkle with chopped peanuts.
