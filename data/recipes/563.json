Mix in the sugar, mixed spice and dried fruit until evenly distributed.   Add the egg and tea and bring the mixture together to form a dough.  Knead on a clean work surface until smooth. Place back in the bowl, cover with oiled cling film and leave until doubled in size - at least one hour. Preheat the oven to 200C\/180C fan\/400F\/Gas 6 and grease a 900g\/2lb loaf tin. Knock back the dough, then shape it and fit it into the loaf tin. Cover again with oiled cling film and prove for a further 30 minutes. Remove the cling film and bake in the centre of the oven for 20 minutes.   Cover the bara brith with aluminium foil and continue to bake for a further 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven, turn it out of the tin and leave to cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes.   For the sugar syrup, bring 50ml\/1¾fl oz of water and the sugar to the boil in a small saucepan and cook until syrupy. Remove from the heat and brush the loaf with the glaze.
