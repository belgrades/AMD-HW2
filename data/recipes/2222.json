Place the butter and sugar into a bowl and beat together until light and fluffy.  Place the chocolate into a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water) and stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Add the melted chocolate to the butter mixture and beat to combine. Add the flour, cocoa powder and eggs and mix well, then fold in 250g\/9oz of the raspberries. Grease and line a 25cm x 30cm (10in x12in) baking tin. Pour the mixture into the tin, then transfer to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until set but still moist in the middle. Meanwhile, place the remainder of the raspberries and the icing sugar into a food processor and blend to a purée. Pass through a sieve into a clean bowl. Place the mascarpone in a bowl and mix in half of the raspberry purée. To serve, cut the brownie into pieces and place onto serving plates with a dollop of raspberry cream. Drizzle over the remaining raspberry purée.
