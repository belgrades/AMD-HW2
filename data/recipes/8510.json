Add the raisins and cinnamon and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, until the apples are softened and caramelised. Squeeze in the lemon juice and stir to combine. For the custard, place the milk and cream into a saucepan and bring up to the boil. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Place the egg and egg yolk and the sugar into a bowl and mix well. Gradually pour the milk and cream over the egg mixture, then return the mixture to the pan over a gentle heat. Stir constantly until the custard starts to thicken. When it coats the back of a spoon, remove from the heat and pour through a sieve into a jug or bowl. To serve, place the apples onto a plate and drizzle over the custard.
