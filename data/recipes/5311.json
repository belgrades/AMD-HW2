{"recipe_name":"Lobster and sea bass with carrot julienne","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the lobster sauce, cut the lobsters in half lengthways and pull out the meat. Crack the claws and remove the claw meat in one piece. Set aside the lobster meat and roughly chop the shells. Heat a large sauté pan until hot, add half the butter, the onion, ginger and thyme and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until just softened but not coloured. Add the lobster shells and tomato purée and cook for one minute. Add the white wine and chicken stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Place in a food blender in batches and blend to a purée. Press through a fine sieve into a saucepan, whisk in the cream and check the seasoning, adding salt and pepper if necessary. When ready to serve, blend the sauce with a stick blender to create a light foam. Cut the lobster tail into large dice. Heat a frying pan until medium hot, add the remaining butter and lobster meat and claws and cook on each side for 1-2 minutes, or until just coloured and hot through. Season with salt and black pepper. For the sea bass, season the sea bass with a little salt. Heat a frying pan until medium hot, add a knob of butter and the olive oil and heat until just foaming. Add the sea bass, skin side down and pan fry for two minutes until the skin is crisp and the fish nearly cooked through. Flip over and cook on the flesh side for one minute, basting with the butter. Remove from the heat and leave to rest for one minute. Heat a separate frying pan until medium hot, add the remaining butter and the carrot and leek and stir fry for a couple of minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and just wilted down. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, pile the julienne into the centre of the plate then top with the sea bass. Place pieces of the lobster around the plate then spoon the foamy sauce over and around. Finish with the lobster claw on top of the sea bass.
