Then either churn in an ice cream maker or pour into plastic dishes to a depth of no more than 2cm\/¾in. If you're using plastic dishes, then remove them from the freezer when the mixture is just frozen (but not rock hard) and scratch up into a soft sorbet using a fork - if you've never tried this method you'll soon get the hang of it. Either serve straightaway or pack into tubs and freeze. Defrost for 30-60 minutes at room temperature before serving. Serve with a  couple of tsps of calvados over the sorbet.
