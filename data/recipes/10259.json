Do not leave unattended). Mix the flour and water together in a bowl to make a thin, smooth batter. Dip the prawns into the batter to coat. Carefully drop the prawns into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the mango, chilli and lettuce cups, mix the mango, lime zest and juice and chilli together in a bowl. Place the lettuce leaves onto a plate. Spoon the mango mixture into the middle of each leaf and top with a prawn. Serve immediately.
