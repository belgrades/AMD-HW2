To make the bruschetta, heat a griddle pan until smoking. Drizzle the soda farl slices with olive oil, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place onto the hot griddle to char-grill for two minutes on each side. For the poached kipper, place the milk, onion, bay and thyme into a wide shallow pan. Bring up to a low simmer and allow to infuse for a few minutes. Add the kipper and poach for five minutes, or until heated through, then remove the kipper and set aside in a warm place. To make the sauce, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry for two minutes to soften. Add the mustard and vinegar and cook for two minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer and simmer for five minutes, until thickened and reduced. To make the poached egg, place the water and vinegar in a saucepan and heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Swirl the water with a spoon to create a whirlpool effect. Gently add the egg and poach for three minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Remove with a slotted spoon and carefully rinse with hot water. To serve, place the two slices of bruschetta onto a warm plate, place the poached egg on one slice and the poached kipper on the other. Spoon the sauce over both.
