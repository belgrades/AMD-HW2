{"recipe_name":"Deep-fried Port Salut on spicy lentils","author":"Lesley Waters","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the deep-fried cheese, heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (Caution: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dredge the cheese in the seasoned flour. Dip the cheese into the egg mixture, then dip into the breadcrumbs. Repeat the coatings of egg then breadcrumbs twice more to fully coat the cheese. Add the cheese to the hot oil and deep fry until crisp and golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with sea salt. For the lentils, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and garlic and fry until softened. Add the curry powder and turmeric and fry for one minute. Add the lentils and cook for one minute. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 13 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, place the lentils onto a plate with the deep-fried cheese wedges placed on top.
