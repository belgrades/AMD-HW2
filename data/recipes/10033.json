Pour the mixture into a jug. Heat a 20-25cm\/8-10in non-stick frying pan until hot and brush with a little oil.  Pour in a little of the batter and swirl it around the pan to make a full sized pancake.  Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until golden at the edges. Loosen and flip over with a spatula. Cook until golden on both sides. Repeat with the remaining batter.  You can keep the cooked pancakes warm by wrapping in foil and placing in a low temperature oven.  Put the pancakes on plates and top with the bananas, blueberries, pecans and maple syrup.  Serve immediately.
