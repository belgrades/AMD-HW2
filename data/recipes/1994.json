Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then cook skin-side down in a hot pan for 4-5 minutes, until the skin is crisp and golden-brown. Turn the breast over to cook for one minute, then transfer to a deep ovenproof dish, skin-side up. Add enough chicken stock to come a third of the way up the chicken. Place into the oven and cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through.  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan. When the butter is foaming, add the mushrooms and fry for 3-4 minutes, until golden. Add the white wine and boil for 2-3 minutesto reduce the liquid almost completely. Add the cream, spinach and tarragon and boil to reduce the liquid by a third. For the rice, place the cooked rice into a bowl, add the nuts and butter and mix together well.
