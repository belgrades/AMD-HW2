{"recipe_name":"Roast salmon with dill and mustard and pea purée ","author":"Vivek Singh","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the salmon, pat the fish dry using kitchen paper.  Mix together one teaspoon of the vegetable oil, the ginger-garlic paste and the salt in a small bowl. Rub this mixture over the fish and set aside for five minutes. Meanwhile, mix together a second marinade in a small bowl with the yoghurt, wholegrain mustard, chillies, sugar and dill.  Mix the fish with the second marinade and set aside until you are ready to cook the fish. For the pickled vegetables, place the vinegar and sugar into a saucepan and heat until the sugar has dissolved. Place all the vegetables, except the diced cucumber, into a bowl and pour over the hot vinegar. Stir well then leave for at least five minutes. Place the diced cucumber into a bowl with the sparkling water, then cover and place in the microwave on high for 30 seconds. Remove and drain. For the pea purée, place the peas, ginger, garlic, green chillies, salt, sugar, and one tablespoon of the mustard oil in a food processor and blend to a smooth purée.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl.  Heat the remaining mustard oil in a small pan, add the mustard seeds and curry leaves and let them crackle. Remove from the heat and pour the mixture over the pea purée.  Taste the mixture and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Finish with the lime juice. To cook the salmon, crank up your grill to maximum power and place the fish skin-side up to cook for 3-4 minutes. Serve the fish immediately drizzled with mustard oil. Place a dollop of the green pea relish alongside, plus a green salad and the pickled vegetables topped with the diced cucumber.
