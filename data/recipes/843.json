Put the noodles in a pan and pour over boiling water to cover. Allow to soak for 8 minutes until softened. Heat a wok or frying pan until very hot. Add the oil, then the pork mince with lots of freshly ground black pepper. Break up the mince with a wooden spoon, giving it time to brown before stirring. When browned all over, add the white parts of the spring onion and half of the green. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the soy sauce - it will bubble up quickly and thicken. Immediately transfer the pork mince to a serving bowl. Drain the noodles and stir into the meat along with the red pepper and remaining spring onion. This can be served warm, at room temperature or cold.
