Cover with cling film and gently beat with a rolling pin or meat mallet until 1cm (0.75in) thick. Mix the marinade ingredients on a large flat plate then lightly spread each chicken fillet with the mixture and season. Leave to marinate for a while if times allows. Heat a large non-stick frying pan. Add a little oil and gently fry the chicken breasts for just under two minutes each  side or until just done. To check for doneness take a thin slice off one side of a breast. If the flesh is white it is cooked. Take care not to overcook. Remove any surplus oil from the pan with kitchen paper, then measure the cream into a jug and mix with the leftover paprika mixture from the plate. Pour the paprika cream into the pan around the chicken. Allow to bubble up and reduce slightly. Serve with young spinach and a mixture of boiled rice and wild rice.
