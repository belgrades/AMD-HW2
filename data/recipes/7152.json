Place three cocktail sticks into a bowl of water to soak for ten minutes. Place the pork loin between two pieces of cling film. Flatten out the pork with a meat mallet or the end of a rolling pin, until 1cm\/¼in thick. Place the prunes along the centre of the meat, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and roll up like a cigar. Secure the pork with the soaked cocktail sticks. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof frying pan. Add the tomato halves, sweet potato and the stuffed pork. Cook the pork on all sides until golden-brown all over, then transfer the pan with the pork and vegetables to the oven to roast for 8-10 minutes, or until the pork is completely cooked through. When the pork is cooked, remove from the pan and rest for five minutes in a warm place. Meanwhile, boil the beans in a pot of boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes, until just cooked, then drain. To serve, slice the pork and arrange the slices on a serving plate with the roasted vegetables and beans alongside.
