Soak the sultanas, raisins, currants, figs, peel, apricots and cherries in the brandy overnight, giving it a good stir now and again. The following day, in a large bowl mix the ginger, syrup, apples or quinces, orange juice and zest with the eggs, suet, sugar, crumbs and flour. Stir in the soaked fruit and spice. Grease the two pudding basins and divide the mix between them. Add coins now if using. Cut two circles of greaseproof paper to cover the top of the pudding and fold a pleat down the centre to allow pudding to expand. Put lids on the basins and steam puddings for 3½ hours. Let puddings cool before removing greaseproof paper and covering tightly with cling film and lid. The puddings can now be stored in a cool, dry place until Christmas. To reheat, steam pudding for a further 3½ hours, turn out and flame with brandy.
