Heat the oil in a large lidded pan and add the cumin seeds. When they begin to pop, reduce the heat and add the chilli, ginger and garlic. Add the turnips, salt and turmeric, cover the pan with a lid and cook for ten minutes. Add the spring greens and cook, covered, for a further ten minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are tender but still brightly coloured and slightly crunchy. Serve hot as a side dish, removing the chilli before serving if you wish.
