Add the shallot and fry gently for 4-5 minutes, or until softened but not coloured.  Add the passata and bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering and simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the volume of liquid has reduced slightly and the passata has thickened. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. When the mixture has cooled, stir in the mayonnaise, capers, gherkins, parsley and tarragon. Chill until needed. For the deep-fried Brussels sprouts, heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. Alternatively, heat the vegetable oil in a deep-sided, heavy-based saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (Caution: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) In a bowl, mix the flour and the curry powder together until well combined. Beat the eggs in a bowl. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs on a plate. Dust the sprouts first in the curried flour mixture, shaking off any excess; then dip them in the beaten egg; then roll them in the breadcrumbs until completely coated. Deep-fry the breaded Brussels sprouts in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until crisp, golden-brown and heated through. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. To serve, divide the deep-fried Brussels sprouts among four serving plates. Spoon a little of the tomato tartare alongside.
