Rinse under cold water to remove the starch and leave to drain until cool enough to handle.  Preheat the oven to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4. Mix all the ingredients, except the oil, for the bulgur wheat balls together. Squeeze the mixture using your hands so it sticks together. Shape the mixture into golf-ball sized balls or patties, don't worry about making them into perfect balls. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil, once hot add the balls and fry or 3-4 minutes. Finish them in the oven for 5-10 minutes if you like. Serve on sticks with a drizzle of Greek style yoghurt, sweet tamarind sauce, a sprinkle of nigella seeds and more fresh coriander.
