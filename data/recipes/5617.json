Cover and sweat for four minutes, until soft and a little golden. Allow to cool. In a bowl, mix the minced beef with the cold sweated onion and garlic. Add the herbs and the beaten egg. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Fry a tiny bit to check the seasoning and adjust if necessary. Divide the mixture into approximately 24 round balls. Cover the meatballs and refrigerate until required. Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Heat the oil in a stainless steel saucepan.  Add the sliced onion and the crushed garlic, toss until coated, cover, and sweat on a gentle heat until soft and pale golden. Slice the canned tomatoes and add, with all the juice, to the onion mixture.   Season the contents with sugar, salt and freshly ground pepper. Cook the tomatoes uncovered for approximately 30 minutes or until the tomato softens (while this is cooking make the meatballs). Heat a frying pan and cook the meatballs for about 10 minutes in about three tablespoons of olive oil. When they are cooked, put them into an ovenproof dish with the tomato sauce and top with the grated mozzarella. Place under a preheated grill until the cheese has melted.  Serve with spaghetti.
