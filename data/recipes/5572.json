This is known as the soft ball stage, when a drop placed in cold water to cool down, it will form a soft ball.  In a bowl, mix together the ground almonds, egg white and almond extract. Pour the sugar syrup over the ground almonds and mix vigorously until the mixture forms a thick paste.  Chill the marzipan in the fridge for 1-2 hours, or until firm. For the tart, preheat the oven to 210C\/425F\/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Roll the puff pastry out thinly on a floured surface. Cut out 4 x 12cm\/4½ in circles, and lay them onto the baking tray. Leaving a gap of about a centimetre round the edge, lightly score the middles of each pastry circle with a small sharp knife, making a grid of lines. This will stop the pastry puffing up too much in the middle. Brush each pastry circle with the beaten egg. Roll the chilled marzipan out to 5mm\/¼in thick. (If the marzipan is too hard to rollout, allow it to warm slightly at room temperature.) Cut out 4 x 11cm\/4in circles and place each marzipan circle on top of a pastry circle. Arrange the apple slices, overlapping in concentric circles, on top of each circle of marzipan so that all of the marzipan is covered.  Heat the butter in a saucepan until just melted then brush over the top of the apples and sprinkle the sugar over the top. Transfer to the oven to bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the pastry is risen and golden-brown.  Meanwhile, place the apricot jam and a tablespoon of water into a saucepan and heat until the jam has melted. Pass the jam through a fine sieve into a bowl. Remove the tarts from the oven and brush with the melted apricot jam.  For the sauce, heat the sugar and butter in a small saucepan until melted and well combined.  Pour in the double cream and simmer gently for 3-5 minutes, or until the mixture thickens slightly. To serve, place a tart into the centre of each serving plate, drizzle the caramel sauce around the outside. Top with a ball of ice cream and sprig of mint and serve immediately.
