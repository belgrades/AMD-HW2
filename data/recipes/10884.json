{"recipe_name":"Victorian Christmas roast turkey with bread sauce","author":null,"programme":null,"prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 10-12","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the forcemeat stuffing, mix together all the forcemeat stuffing ingredients, except for the butter and egg yolks, in a bowl until well combined.  Add the softened butter and mix thoroughly, using your hands, until well combined.  Add the egg yolks and work them into the mixture, using your hands, until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Moisten your fingers with water, then carefully slide your fingers under the skin of each side of the turkey breast, until your fingers reach the end of the breast, to separate the skin from the meat. Stuff the cavity between the skin and breast with the forcemeat stuffing. Fold the excess flaps of skin back into the cavity of the bird. Truss the legs of the turkey with cooking string. Grease a sheet of greaseproof paper all over with butter and lay it on top of the stuffed turkey breast. Secure the sheet of greaseproof paper to the turkey using cooking string. Transfer the turkey to a large roasting tin and roast for between 3 hours 20 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the weight of your turkey, or until cooked through. (NB: The turkey is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.) During cooking, baste the turkey all over with melted butter, at 15 minute intervals. Remove the sheet of greaseproof paper covering the turkey breast 20 minutes before you remove the turkey from the oven. Meanwhile, for the bread sauce, bring the shallots and milk to a simmer in a saucepan. Continue to simmer gently for 5-10 minutes, or until the shallots have softened.  Strain the milk mixture through an unbleached muslin cloth or fine sieve into a clean pan (discard the shallots). Add the breadcrumbs and stir well to combine. Set the milk and breadcrumb mixture aside to soak for one hour, or until the sauce has thickened. When the bread sauce has thickened, fluff the mixture with a fork, then beat in the ground mace, cayenne pepper and salt, to taste.  Add the butter and bring to the bread sauce mixture to the boil. Just before serving, add a splash of double cream, if using, to the bread sauce and stir well to combine (this will enrich the sauce). When the turkey is ready to serve, carve the stuffed breast into thin slices. Serve with the bread sauce.
