Melt the chocolate slowly, stirring occasionally.  Line a tray with a sheet of baking paper and spoon the chocolate into 18 x 8cm\/3in diamater circles. (If necessary, you can tidy up the circles using a round pastry cutter when the chocolate is nearly set.) Put in a cool place to set completely. Whisk the cream and mascarpone together until fairly firm, then mix in the chestnut purée and coffee extract.  Build each millefeuille by spooning some coffee chestnut cream on a chocolate disc and setting a second disc on top. Add another blob of chestnut cream and finally a third disc. Repeat with the remaining chocolate circles to make six millefeuilles. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve, then sprinkle with cocoa powder and icing sugar, or grated chocolate.
