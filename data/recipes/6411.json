{"recipe_name":"Pan-fried salmon with aster tripolium and scallop broth","author":"James Martin","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the grill to high.  For the salmon, place the slices of salmon onto a grill tray lined with aluminium foil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside. For the aster tripolium and scallop broth, heat a frying pan until hot. Add half the butter and the slices of white scallop meat. Fry for one minute or until just cooked through (take care not to overcook the scallops or they will become tough and rubbery). Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the aster tripolium or samphire to the same pan used to cook the scallops and fry for 2-3 minutes.  Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a clean frying pan over a medium heat. Add the scallop corals and fry for one minute. Add the white wine and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the volume of liquid is reduced by half.  Add the cream and bring back to a simmer for one minute. Transfer the coral mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Pour the blended coral cream into the pan containing the aster tripolium or samphire, add the slices of white scallop meat and gently heat through. Meanwhile, for the salmon, place the salmon strips under the grill for 2-3 minutes or until just cooked through. To serve, spoon the scallop broth onto each of four serving plates and top with the slices of salmon.
