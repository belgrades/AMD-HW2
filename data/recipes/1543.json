{"recipe_name":"Chargrilled calves' liver with sage and potato rosti","author":"James Martin","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the rösti, squeeze the grated potato out into a clean tea towel until dry, then place into a bowl. Place the egg yolk and yoghurt into a separate bowl and whisk together. Add the grated potato and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Melt the butter in a small frying pan. Add the potato mixture to the pan, pressing it down into a disc shape in the pan. Cook over a medium heat until golden brown underneath, then turn the rösti over and cook the other side until golden-brown. For the liver, heat a griddle pan until smoking. Drizzle the griddle pan with one tablespoon of the oil, then add the calves' liver and griddle for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through. Remove from the pan and leave to rest in warm place.  Add the remaining half tablespoon of oil to a frying pan and add the sage leaves. Fry the sage for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp. To serve, place the rösti into the centre of a plate and place the liver on top. Garnish with the sage leaves.
