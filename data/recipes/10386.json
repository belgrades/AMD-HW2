Bring the kettle to the boil. Warm a clean teapot with a little of the water just before it reaches boiling point, then swirl around and pour away.  Use tea leaves rather than bags for a fresh flavoured tea  the type you use is up to you. Allow 1 teaspoon per person, plus one for the pot. Make sure the pot you're using has plenty of space for the tea to brew in the water.  Pour in the water as soon as it boils, taking the pot to the kettle so the water doesn't have a chance to cool down. Cover the pot with a tea cosy (either one your Granny knitted or one of the cool, funky ones available now) and leave the tea to infuse for 3-4 minutes. Any longer and you'll ruin the true flavour of the tea, making it taste bitter. When you're ready, pour the tea through a tea strainer (unless there's a mesh attached to your teapot) into sparkling clean mugs or cups and saucers.  When you add the milk depends on whether you're a MIF (milk-in-first) or TIF (tea-in-first) person, or maybe you prefer it black, with sugar, a slice of lemon or a sprig of mint. Sit back and enjoy ","ingredients":" 1 tsp tea leaves per person,  milk (optional),  sugar (optional)","vegetarian":true,"calories":null,"protein":null,"carbs":null,"sugars":null,"total_fat":null,"saturated_fat":null,"fiber":null,"salt":null,"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/theperfectcuppa_67502"}
