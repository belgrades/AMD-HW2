Use a knife-sharpening steel to push a hole through the centre of the pork fillet to create a pocket. Stuff with the prunes. Heat a tablespoon of oil in an oven-proof pan. Add the pork and cook for two minutes on each side to seal the meat. Meanwhile, heat another tablespoon of oil in an oven-proof pan and sauté the sweet potato cubes for four minutes. Transfer both pans to the oven for about 15 minutes, or until cooked to taste. For the leeks, heat a griddle pan and chargrill the leeks for four to five minutes, turning to ensure even colouring. To serve, divide the baby leeks between two plates, top with sweet potato cubes and slice the pork on top.
