Heat the remaining two tablespoons of vegetable oil and add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, peppercorns and mace. Fry until the spices start to crackle, then add the chilli, ginger, onions and curry leaves. Fry the spices and onions for 4-5 minutes, or until onions are translucent. Add the turmeric, coriander, black pepper and cinnamon powder and continue to fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the coconut milk and heat to a gentle simmer.   Add the cooked chicken pieces and the tomatoes and simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through (no pink should remain when the chicken is cut into).
