{"recipe_name":"Pea and mint soup with a soft poached egg","author":"James Tanner","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the soup, heat the olive oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the peas and stock and leave to simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until the peas are tender.  Stir in the mint and cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using a stick blender, process the soup until smooth. Keep warm.  For the soft poached egg, bring a pan of water to the boil, then add the vinegar and reduce to a gentle simmer. Crack the egg into a bowl. Using a ladle, swirl the water in the pan to create a whirlpool, then carefully pour the egg into the centre of the whirlpool. Poach for 2-3 minutes, or until the whites are just set, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.  To serve, spoon the soup into a bowl and top with the poached egg.
