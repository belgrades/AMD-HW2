{"recipe_name":"Prawn and mango and pork and water chestnut lettuce cups with a 10-second egg-free miracle mayo","author":"Annabel Langbein","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 8-10","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the mayo, put all the ingredients in a jug and blend using a hand blender until thick and creamy - about 10 seconds. Store in an airtight container in the fridge (it will keep for about 2 weeks). For the prawn and mango cups, arrange the lettuce leaves on a large platter. Top each with a teaspoon of mayonnaise, a slice of avocado and then a prawn half. Scatter with mango, season with salt and pepper, drizzle with lemon juice and top with herbs. For the pork and water chestnut lettuce cups, mix the mince in a bowl with the sesame oil, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger and garlic. Put to one side while you prepare the other ingredients.  Heat the oil in a large wok or heavy-based frying pan. When hot, stir-fry the mince over a high heat, breaking it up to a fine crumb. Cook until it is no longer pink. Add the water chestnuts, cabbage and peas. Stir fry until the cabbage is wilted (2-3 minutes), adding a splash of water if pan is too dry. Remove from heat and stir in the oyster sauce and chilli flakes, if using.  Mix in the spring onions. Transfer to a bowl and serve with lettuce leaves to wrap and peanuts to garnish. Serve the prawn and mango cups alongside.
