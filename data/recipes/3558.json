When it darkens to a deep caramel colour, using an oiled spoon, drizzle the caramel onto a piece of non-stick baking paper and leave to cool. Heat the almonds in a dry pan over medium heat, and fry until toasted and golden all over. Allow to cool. Place the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice into a food processor and blend until smooth. Transfer into a sieve and push through with a spoon to remove the seeds.  Place the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk until the mixture forms stiff peaks when the whisk is removed. Gradually add the caster sugar until it is all incorporated, whisking continuously.  The mixture will become very thick and glossy. Boil a saucepan of water and drop teaspoonfuls of meringue into the water to poach for 3-4 minutes. Pour the raspberry coulis onto a serving plate, and carefully tip it around so it covers the base. Arrange the poached meringues into the centre and sprinkle over the toasted almonds and shards of caramel.
