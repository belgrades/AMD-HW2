Preheat the grill to its highest setting. For the marinade, place all of the marinade ingredients into a large bowl and mix together well. Line a large roasting tray with a piece of aluminium foil twice the size of the tray. Place the peppers onto one half of the foil placed in the roasting tin, season with freshly ground black pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Fold over the other half of the foil to seal the peppers and place into the oven to roast for 20 minutes, turning from time to time.  Once the peppers are cooked and softened, place into a bowl and cover with cling film. Once cooled, peel the peppers and cut into large, but even triangles and place into the marinade. Place the courgette and aubergine slices onto a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place under the hot grill. Grill both sides for 3-4 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the heat and place into the marinade with the peppers. Turn down the grill to a moderate heat. Place the goats' cheese rounds onto a baking sheet and place under a moderate grill. Grill for 2-3 minutes, until the cheese has melted and begun to brown. To serve, place the salad leaves into a large serving bowl. Add the marinated vegetables and top with the grilled goats' cheese. Drizzle with a little of the marinade and serve.
