In a large saucepan, heat the bones with a drop of vegetable oil, add the shallot and butter. Fry until golden-brown. Add the garlic and half the thyme. Drain away most of the fat, just cover with water and simmer for 1 hour. Pass the liquor through a sieve, discard the bones and vegetables. In a clean pan, bring the liquor to the boil and simmer until it is reduced to a nice syrupy consistency. Whisk in a little extra butter just before serving. Preheat the oven to 195C\/175C Fan\/Gas 6. Heat a little oil in a frying pan, once hot, add the grouse fillets skin-side down and fry until the skin is golden-brown. Place a spring of thyme on top of each fillet and wrap the fillets in the blackcurrant leaves. In another pan, gently fry the turnips and the girolles in butter for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, and allow the turnip leaves to wilt in the residual heat. Finish cooking the grouse in the oven for 5 minutes  In the same pan that the girolles were cooked in, quickly fry the blackcurrants, and glaze them with a spoonful of water. Pour into the grouse jus. To serve, arrange the girolles and turnips on four serving plates. Scatter over the walnuts. Serve the grouse still in the leaves straight from the oven with the jus drizzled over.
