Place a frying pan over a medium heat. When the pan is hot add the duck skin-side down and cook for five minutes, until the skin is browned. Pour off the excess fat produced by the duck, then turn and cook for a further three minutes. Drizzle over the honey and cook for a further two minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Remove the duck from the heat, sprinkle with sesame seeds and allow to rest on a warm plate two minutes, then slice into thin strips on the diagonal. To make the oriental salad, place the oils, sesame seeds, soy sauce, honey and lime juice into a bowl and mix together well. Add the spinach and toss well to coat in the dressing. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle with flatleaf parsley and toasted sesame seeds. To serve, arrange the salad on a large plate and place the duck slices in the centre of the salad.
