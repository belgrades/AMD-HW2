Squeeze the excess water from the gelatine and whisk the gelatine into the cream. Pour into 10 dariole moulds. Top each one with four raspberries and place in the fridge for four hours. For the doughnuts, mix the flour, salt, sugar, butter, yeast, eggs and milk with 130ml\/4fl oz water in a large bowl to make a dough. Knead for 4-5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth. Place in a large, clean oiled bowl, cover and leave to prove in a warm place for an hour, or until doubled in size. Divide the dough into 20 equally sized, small pieces and shape each into a smooth ball.  Heat the oil to 160C\/320F in a heavy-based saucepan or deep-fat fryer using a cooking thermometer to check the temperature. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) When the oil is hot, fry the doughnuts in batches until golden-brown. Drain on kitchen paper. Make a sauce by blending the raspberries to a purée in a food processor. Pass through a sieve and discard any seeds. When ready to serve, coat the warm doughnuts in caster sugar. Place a panna cotta in the centre of each plate, drizzle the sauce around and finish with a few raspberries, mint leaves and serve with the doughnuts.
