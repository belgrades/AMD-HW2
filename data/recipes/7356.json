Put the wine and vinegar in a saucepan, add the salt and bring to the boil. Add the courgettes and leave for five minutes (it goes pulpy if you leave it longer). Drain the courgettes and place on a clean cloth to dry.  Layer the courgettes in a sterilised jar with the parsley, garlic and pepper. Push it down to get as much as you can in. Cover in oil. Make sure the air is expelled by pushing a long knife around the edges of the jar to release any air bubbles. Tapping the jar also releases these. Keep topped up with olive oil once opened and store in the refrigerator. Use within a month.
