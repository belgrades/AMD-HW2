Cook the beans in simmering salted water for two minutes. Drain and cool under cold running water. Mix the minced pork with the soy sauce, cornflour, sugar, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat one tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a wok. When the oil is hot add the beans and stir-fry quickly with a pinch of salt for one minute until wrinkled. Remove the beans and reheat the wok, adding the remaining vegetable oil and the garlic cloves. When hot, discard the garlic (it will have flavoured the oil sufficiently) and add the pork mixture. Stir-fry quickly for three minutes until it darkens. Add the rice wine and chilli oil and stir through.  Return the beans to the sauce and stir-fry briefly until mixed. Serve with plenty of steamed rice.
