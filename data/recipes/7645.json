Remove the mixture from the processor, and pull the dough together into a ball. Knead the dough until smooth. Wrap the pasta dough in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Once rested, take the dough out of the fridge and roll out to about 1cm\/½in thick. Pass the rolled dough through a pasta machine, starting with the widest setting, and reducing the setting each time until on the finest setting.
