{"recipe_name":"Crispy chilli beef","author":"Andrew Wong","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2-4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Put the beef in the freezer for around 1½ hours until it is about 70% frozen. For the marinade, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl with 50ml\/2fl oz water. Using a sharp knife, cut the partially frozen beef into 7cmx5mm\/2¾x⅛in batons. Add the beef batons to the marinade, cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 2 hours. For the pickled carrot, place the carrot in a sterilized airtight container. Heat up all the remaining ingredients in a non-reactive pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Pour over the carrot strips and leave to cool. Seal the container. (It will keep for several months if stored in a cool, dry place.) For the Chinese five-spice salt, mix the powder and salt and combine thoroughly.  For the sauce, combine all the ingredients and 400ml\/14fl oz water in a pan and cook until the mixture has reduced to the consistency of honey. For the batter, combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, then whisk in enough sparkling water until you have a light batter When the beef is ready, heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. Alternatively, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.). Remove the beef from the marinade, coat the beef in cornflour and plunge the batons individually into the batter before deep-frying until crispy (the fried batter coating should have miniature holes throughout instead of being a solid shell). Remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper. Add the beef to the sauce, season with a pinch of chilli flakes, Chinese five-spice salt and sesame seeds. Top with some pickled carrots, garnish with viola flowers, if using, and serve immediately.
