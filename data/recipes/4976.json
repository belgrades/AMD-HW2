Leave to stand for ten minutes, then drain and pat dry with kitchen towels to remove excess water. Place the wheat germ, lamb mince, egg, onion, pine nuts and parsley into a large bowl and mix together well. Roll small lumps of the lamb mixture into small balls, the size of a golf ball and place onto a greased baking sheet, cover with cling film and place into the fridge to chill for 30-45 minutes. Meanwhile, for the spiced yoghurt, place the chilli, mint, parsley, coriander, garlic, cumin and yoghurt into a clean bowl and mix thoroughly. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the kofta balls and fry, turning regularly, until browned and cooked all the way through.
