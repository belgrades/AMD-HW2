Pour over 500ml\/17fl oz water, add the bay leaves and bring the water to a gentle simmer.  Cook the fish for 8-10 minutes until it is just done and flakes easily.  Drain in a colander set over a bowl, reserving the cooking liquor, and discard the bay leaves. Pour the cooking liquor into a medium saucepan and stir in the rice.  Cover with a lid and bring to the boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer the rice very gently for 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat and leave the rice covered for 3-5 minutes more.  By this time it should have absorbed all the fish liquor. While the rice is cooking, bring some water to the boil in a medium pan.  Add the eggs and cook for eight minutes.  Drain them in a sieve under cold running water and when cool enough to handle, peel them carefully and set aside.  Cook the peas, if using, in a small pan of boiling water and drain. Melt the butter with the oil in a large pan and cook the onion over a low hear for five minutes until well softened, stirring occasionally.  Add the curry powder and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Place the cooked rice into the pan and stir in the onions.  Add the peas, cream, parsley and a few twists of ground black pepper. Flake the fish into chunky pieces and add these to the pan.  Gently stir the lemon juice and cook for 1-2 minutes.  Cut the eggs into quarters and place them on the rice.  Cover the pan with a lid and heat through for 2-3 minutes or until the eggs are warm, then serve. If not serving immediately, tip the kedgeree into a warm dish and dot with a few cubes of butter.  Cover with foil and keep warm in a low oven for up to 20 minutes before serving.
