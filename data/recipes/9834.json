Line a baking tray with parchment paper. For the meringue, place the egg whites into a large food processor with a whisk attachment, and whisk until soft peaks are formed when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Gradually add the sugar and whisk until firm. Gently fold in the cornflour and vinegar. Spoon the meringue onto the baking tray to make a large nest shape.

For the strawberry, white chocolate and vanilla cream filling, paint the melted chocolate inside the nest of the cooled pavlova.
