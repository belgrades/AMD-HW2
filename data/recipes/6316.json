Place the eggs, orange zest, flour, baking powder and milk into a large bowl and whisk together to form a smooth batter. Heat the butter and oil in a shallow frying pan over a medium heat. Ladle a quarter of the batter mixture to the pan to make a large thick pancake. Cook for one minute on each side, until golden. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat the pancake-making process to cook three more pancakes. Once you have four pancakes placed on the baking sheet, place into the oven to bake for two minutes.
