Drain and cool in iced water. Once cold, the beans are ready to drain and re-pod (double podding stage): remove the skin from the bright green beans. Place the broad beans (saving a few for garnish), chickpeas, crushed garlic, tahini paste, lemon juice, salt, cumin, white pepper and caster sugar, if using, in a food processor and blend until smooth, loosening with the reserved chickpea liquor. As the mix continues to purée, slowly pour in the olive oil until completely combined. Serve the homemade broad bean hummus spooned or piped into a bowl, topped with the saved broad beans, toasted sesame seeds and a little drizzle of olive oil with the melba toast.
