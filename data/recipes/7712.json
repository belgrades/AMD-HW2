Cook for 8-10 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender, then set aside from the heat to cool. Taste the rhubarb and, if necessary, add a little caster sugar to sweeten. Meanwhile, whip the double cream in a large bowl. Add the custard, egg whites and sugar.   Spoon a little of the rhubarb into the bottom of four serving glasses.  Set aside four tablespoons of rhubarb and fold the rest into the cream mixture. Spoon half of the rhubarb cream mixture onto the rhubarb in the glasses. Divide half of the passion fruit seeds out onto the top of the rhubarb cream layer, then top with the remaining rhubarb cream mixture.  Finish each glass with a spoonful of rhubarb and the remaining passion fruit.  Chill for at least half an hour before serving in the glasses.
