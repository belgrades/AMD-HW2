{"recipe_name":"Blackened Norfolk duckling crown","author":"Galton Blackiston","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the duck, preheat the oven to 200C\/180C Fan\/Gas 6. Put the honey and a good pinch of salt in a saucepan with 4 tablespoons water. Bring to the boil and then turn off the heat (don’t reduce the liquid otherwise the glaze will become too syrupy and might burn). Brush the glaze over the duck crowns. Put the duck crowns breast-side up on a rack sat in a roasting tin. Roast for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4 and roast for a further 20 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and deeply golden-brown. Remove from the oven and leave somewhere warm to rest for 10 minutes. For the vegetables, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C, or alternatively half fill a deep heavy pan with oil and heat until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped in. (Caution: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Take the breasts off the bone, place on a tray and finish under a medium-high grill. Meanwhile, deep fry the potatoes for 3-4 minutes until golden-brown and crisp. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Cook the peas in boiling salted water with a sprig of mint for 1-2 minutes. Cook the carrots and baby turnips in boiling salted water for 3 minutes, then transfer to a frying pan with a knob of butter and fry gently until tender. Serve the duck and potatoes with carrots, peas and turnips. Finish with the reduced duck stock.
