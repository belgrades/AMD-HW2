Place the flour, baking powder and oil into a food processor and blend together.  Add the milk and blend to form a smooth dough. Using a rolling pin on a floured surface, roll the pastry out to 2.5cm\/1in thickness. Using a plate as a guide, cut out a 20cm\/8in circle and place onto a non-stick baking sheet. Reserve some of the dough for later. Using the excess dough, roll eight small balls and place evenly around the outside of the dough circle to decorate. Crumble the blue cheese into the circle and drizzle with the white wine. Place into the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Remove from the oven and place on a large warm plate. Meanwhile, for the balsamic sauce, place the red wine and balsamic vinegar in a saucepan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil then simmer until the sauce becomes thick and glossy. To serve, pour the balsamic sauce around the cheese galette.
