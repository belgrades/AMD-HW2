{"recipe_name":"Wagyu sirloin and slow-cooked brisket, sprouting broccoli, wagyu tartare on puffed heel tendon","author":"Paul Foster","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the tartare, first cure the egg yolks. Put a layer of salt in the bottom of a small container, lay the egg yolks on top and cover with more salt. Cover and put in the fridge for 12 hours.  Wash the egg yolks gently in cold water and place in a dehydrator set as 40C for 24 hours. Boil the beef heel tendons for 4 hours until very soft. Place on a tray and leave to cool and firm up. Slice thinly and dehydrate until hard. Fill a deep-fat fryer with oil and heat to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Add the beef heel tendons and fry until light and fluffy. Remove the beef using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Season with sea salt and set aside.  Chop the Wagyu sirloin into 5mm\/¼in squares. Mix with the shallot and parsley and season with sea salt. Set aside until needed. For the brisket, preheat the oven to 140C\/120C Fan\/Gas 1. Heat the oil in a large casserole. Add the onions and brisket and fry for a few minutes, until the meat is browned all over and the onions are soft. Pour in the ale, stock and honey. Cover with a lid and bake for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender. Carefully remove the brisket from the casserole and keep warm.  Pass the cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a saucepan. Cook over a medium heat until reduced to a glaze. Season, to taste, with sea salt and cabernet sauvignon vinegar.  For the dressing, fry the smoked garlic in a hot pan in a splash of oil until golden-brown, then reduce the heat and cook until soft. Add the vinegar and sugar and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat. Transfer the garlic to a blender, add most of the cooking liquid and blend until smooth. Add a little more cooking liquid if needed to achieve a smooth dressing (it should be fairly thick as you will add the parsley oil at the last minute). Set aside until needed. For the Wagyu sirloin, heat the oil in heavy-based frying pan. When hot, add the Wagyu sirloin and fry for 15-20 seconds. Turn and fry the other side for 15-20 seconds. Repeat this process for 2-3 minutes, adding the butter for the final minute. (This will keep the heat in the pan and build up a nice crust while keeping the centre moist and pink.) Set aside on a wire rack to rest for 5 minutes. For the sprouting broccoli, blanch the stalks for 2 minutes, the florets for 1 minute and the leaves for 30 seconds. Dress with butter and season with sea salt. To serve, glaze the brisket in the reduced cooking liquor. Carve the Wagyu steak and season with salt.  Divide the brisket, steak and broccoli between four serving plates. Mix the parsley oil with the smoked garlic dressing and drizzle over the steak. Spoon the tartare onto the puffed beef heel tendon, grate over the cured egg yolks and serve on the side.
