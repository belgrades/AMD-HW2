{"recipe_name":"Lemon polenta cake with lemon icing","author":"Nick Nairn","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Makes 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Grease a small microwave-safe bowl with butter. Place the butter, polenta, flour, sugar, eggs and lemon zest into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour the cake mixture into the greased bowl and cover with cling film.  Place into the microwave and cook on the highest power for 5-8 minutes, until cooked through. You can test this by piercing the cake with a skewer and removing it - if the skewer comes away clean then the cake is ready. For the lemon icing, sift the icing sugar into a bowl, add the lemon juice and mix well. To serve, tip the pudding and bowl upside-down onto a plate and remove the bowl. Drizzle over the lemon icing and honey and garnish with fresh mint.
