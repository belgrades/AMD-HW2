{"recipe_name":"Cumin duck with peas and roasted baby beetroots and shallots","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the duck, preheat the oven to 200C\/180C Fan\/Gas 6.  Sprinkle the ground cumin all over the duck breasts. Heat an ovenproof frying pan over a low heat. Add the duck skin-side down and cook slowly until the fat is melted and the skin is crisp. If a lot of fat comes off, drain the pan and add the butter. Turn the duck over and transfer to the oven for 6-8 minutes, depending on the size of the duck breast. Remove from the pan and allow to rest in a warm place, reserving the pan to make the gravy. For the roasted vegetables, heat the oil in a medium frying pan. Peel the boiled shallots and cut the beetroots into quarters. Add the vegetables to the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes, then finish them in the oven for 2-3 minutes. For the peas, add the butter to a large frying pan. Heat until melted, then add the frozen peas, parsley, 50ml\/2fl oz water and double cream. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Warm through over a gentle heat and then transfer to a blender and pulse until you have a very smooth purée. Taste to check the seasoning and add more butter if desired. Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil and cook the pea pods for 1-2 minutes. For the gravy, place the pan used to cook the duck over a medium heat. Add the oil, shallots and garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the Madeira and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half. Add the stock and reduce again. Just before serving pass the gravy through a sieve. To serve, carve the rested duck breasts and place on serving plates. Dress with the roasted beetroots, shallots, peas in their pods, pea purée and gravy. Garnish with pea shoots.
