Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry until softened. Add the leeks and cavolo nero and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the squash, tomatoes, wine and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, then divide between four individual ovenproof dishes or ramekins. For the topping, place the flour, baking powder, salt and butter into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the soured cream and pulse again until it just comes together as a very sticky dough. Spoon dollops of the topping over the contents of each ramekin, then bake for 25 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. For the dressing, place the oil, basil and lemon juice into a clean food processor and blend until smooth. Serve the cobblers at the table in their ramekins and spoon over the dressing.
