{"recipe_name":"Deep-fried fish bites with homemade ketchup and fennel salad","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the tomato ketchup, heat the vinegar, bay, spices and sugar in a heavy-based pan until simmering. Add the remaining ingredients, bring to the boil and stir to prevent the mixture from sticking to the side of the pan.  Reduce the temperature to a simmer and cook for a further 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Blend the mixture in a blender until smooth, then push the ketchup through a sieve. For the fish bites, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with vegetable oil. Heat to 180C. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Meanwhile, mix the yeast and sugar in a bowl. Pour over the beer and vinegar and whisk in the flour and salt. Leave to ferment. It is ready to use when the mixture starts to bubble.  Dip the fish into the batter and deep fry until golden-brown and cooked through (3-4 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the salad, mix together all the ingredients. Put the fish bites in a basket lined with greaseproof paper and serve with the ketchup and salad.
