Place the pan over a high heat and bring to the boil and cook until the liquid volume has reduced by half. Pour the liquid through a fine sieve into a bowl. Place the egg yolks into a food processor and add the reduced liquid. blend the eggs and liquid together while slowly pouring in the melted butter, until a thick mayonnaise is formed. Transfer into a serving jug and set aside. To wilt the spinach, place a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the butter and spinach and stir until it has wilted. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and squeeze out some of the moisture over a colander. To cook the soda farl, place the olive oil into a frying pan over a medium heat. Using a 7cm\/3in ring cutter, cut out a round from the farl. Place the soda farl round into the frying pan and fry on both sides, until browned. To poach the egg, add the white wine vinegar to pan of simmering water. Gently stir the water to create a whirlpool effect. Gently add the egg to the centre of the whirlpool and switch off the heat. Allow to cook for one minute, until the white is firm and the yolk soft (or leave to cook for longer according to your taste). To serve, place the farl in the centre of a dish and place the wilted spinach on top. Scatter the roasted artichoke hearts and peppers around the farl. Place the poached egg on top of the spinach and pour over some of the hollandaise. To finish make a small slit through the egg to allow the yolk to run out.
