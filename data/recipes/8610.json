{"recipe_name":"Scotch eggs","author":"The Hairy Bikers","programme":"The Hairy Bikers: Mums Know Best","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Makes 6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Bring a large pan of water to the boil and cook six of the eggs for 4-5 minutes until they are medium- to hard-boiled. Drain and run under cold water until cooled (this will prevent the yolks from discolouring). Peel and set aside. Beat the remaining two eggs together in a bowl and set aside. In a bowl, mix together the sausage meat, sage, thyme, cayenne pepper and freshly ground black pepper until well combined.  Divide the sausage mixture evenly into six portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten out to form a thin patty. Wrap each patty around the peeled boiled eggs, smoothing out the join and making sure there is no egg left exposed.  Roll the scotch eggs in the flour, then dip in the beaten egg and roll in the fresh breadcrumbs. Dip the coated eggs once more in the egg, then again in the breadcrumbs.  Half-fill a deep, heavy-based pan with the vegetable oil and heat to 170C\/340F, checking the temperature with a digital thermometer (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Fry the scotch eggs in small batches for 4-5 minutes, turning the eggs occasionally, or until golden-brown all over and cooked through. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.  Serve the scotch eggs immediately, sliced in half to reveal the soft yolk.
