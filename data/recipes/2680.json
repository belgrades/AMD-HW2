Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a shallow pan. Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and spring onions and sauté for five minutes, until the spring onions are tender. Add the basil and lemon juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the mushrooms and continue cooking for 3-5 minutes, until browned and cooked through.
