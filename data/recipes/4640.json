Sift in the icing sugar, then work it into the butter, starting slowly at first, then beating more vigorously once all the sugar is combined.  Add the milk and the vanilla, then beat until creamy and smooth.  If the mixture is too stiff, add a little more milk.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all the icing sugar is incorporated. Continue to whisk until light and creamy.  You can colour the buttercream at this stage, or add flavourings such as cocoa or melted chocolate, or lemon or orange zest.
