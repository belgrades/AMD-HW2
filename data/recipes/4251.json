Bring a pan of water to the boil and cook the swede for 8-10 minutes, until softened. Drain and mash until soft. Pass through a sieve until smooth.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Slice the cooked haggis and arrange in a chefs' ring placed on a plate. Spoon the mash on top and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Brush the top with the beaten egg and glaze the top using a blow-torch. Remove the ring. To make the gravy, reduce the beef stock and red wine to thicken.
