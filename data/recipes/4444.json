Add all of the remaining tomato sauce ingredients, except the cornflower, and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally to prevent any sticking or burning. Once boiling, reduce the temperature and simmer, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes. (NB: be careful the mixture doesn't burn or catch on the base of the pan as this will ruin the sauce.) Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. Transfer to a food processor or liquidiser and blend until smooth. Push the sauce through a sieve into a bowl and allow to cool completely. If you find the ketchup is too thin once cold, place into a pan and boil until thickened, stirring frequently. If necessary, add half a teaspoon of cornflour mixed to a paste with water; this will prevent the tomato water separating from the ketchup, but be careful not to make it to starchy and too thick. For the chicken goujons, heat a deep fat fryer to 190C\/375F. Mix the breadcrumbs and the cayenne pepper in a bowl and set aside. Dredge the chicken in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg. Dip the chicken into the spicy breadcrumbs, making sure all the chicken is coated thoroughly. Carefully place the goujons into the deep fat fryer in batches and cook for about 3-4 minutes, until crisp and golden brown and the chicken is completely cooked through. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen paper. Repeat until all the goujons are cooked. To serve, place the chicken goujons onto a large serving plate with a bowl of tomato ketchup alongside.
