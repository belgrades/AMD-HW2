Flatten with a meat mallet or rolling pin to a 0.5cm thickness. Place the beaten eggs into a bowl.  In a bowl, mix together the panko breadcrumbs, parmesan and lemon zest until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Dip each flattened pork chop into the beaten egg, then dredge them in the breadcrumb mixture until completely coated. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the seasoned pork chops (in batches if necessary) and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden-brown on both sides and cooked through. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. (Repeat the process with any remaining pork chops.) Meanwhile, for the sauce, in a bowl, whisk together the finely chopped herbs, capers, lemon zest, lemon juice and garlic until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  To serve, place one pork chop onto each of six serving plates. Place two potatoes alongside each. Drizzle over the sauce.
