Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic, capers and anchovy fillets and cook over a medium heat for five minutes, until the anchovies have dissolved.  Add half of the wine and simmer until it has evaporated, then add the tomatoes, squashing them slightly. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for five minutes, then add the olives and continue to cook for a further 10 minutes. Place the fish in an ovenproof dish and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the parsley, the remaining white wine, the sauce, a drizzle of olive oil and the oregano and cover with foil. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, removing the foil halfway through cooking. Meanwhile, make the salad. Whisk the olive oil and vinegar together with the garlic and mint in a small bowl and set aside. Trim the ends of the courgettes and, with a potato peeler or mandolin, slice them lengthways into wafer-thin slices. Add the courgette slices to the dressing, mix well and leave to marinate for at least 10 minutes.  Mix the rocket with the courgettes and place on serving plates. When the fish is cooked, let it rest for one minute then serve alongside the salad.
