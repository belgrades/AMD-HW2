Mix the self-raising flour, oatmeal, wholemeal flour, caster sugar, baking powder and the salt in a bowl to combine. Add the butter and rub into the flour mixture until it resembles breadcrumbs. Fold in the walnuts. Place the buttermilk and maple syrup into a separate bowl and mix well. Add the buttermilk and maple syrup mixture to the dry mixture and mix well to make a dough. Roll the dough out on a floured work surface to 3cm\/1½in thick. Using a pastry cutter, cut out 12 scones (or as many as the dough will provide). Place onto a greased baking tray and transfer to the oven to bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown. Eat while still warm from the oven.
