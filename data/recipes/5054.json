Heat the oil in a shallow frying pan, then wipe any excess oil away with kitchen paper. Spoon in the batter and swirl to cover the base of the pan. Fry until the underside of the pancake is golden, then turn over and cook the other side until golden-brown. For the filling, place the red wine into a small saucepan and boil to reduce the liquid volume by half. Add the sausage and enough water to cover.
