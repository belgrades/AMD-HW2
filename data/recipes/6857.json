{"recipe_name":"Picnic of piccalilli, ham, anchovy dip and pork pies","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"overnight","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the piccalilli, dissolve the salt in the water in a large bowl. Add the cauliflower and onions and stir well to mix, ensuring they are completely submerged in the water. Cover and place into the fridge for 24 hours. When you're ready to cook the piccalilli, remove the bowl from the fridge and drain the salted water off. Rinse the vegetables well. Place the cauliflower, onions, cucumber and capers into a pan and cover with fresh water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for ten minutes. Drain once more and set the vegetables aside. Meanwhile, heat a pan and cook the butter and flour for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Slowly add the two vinegars, stirring constantly, and cook gently for 2-3 minutes, or until just thickened. Add the sugar, turmeric and mustard powder and season with freshly ground black pepper. Pour the mustard mixture over the vegetables and stir to combine, making sure all the vegetables are covered in the sauce. Pour into sterilised jars and seal. Leave in the fridge for at least five days before eating so that the vegetables can absorb all the flavours. The pickle can be kept in the fridge for up to two weeks. For the ham, place the gammon into a large lidded pan and cover with cold water. Stud the onion with the cloves and add to the water with the bay leaves, thyme and parsley. Bring the water to a rapid boil, then turn down the heat, cover the pan and simmer gently for two hours. When the ham is cooked, take the pan off the heat and leave the ham to cool in the cooking liquid. When cold, remove from the cooking liquid, trim off any excess fat and slice. For the anchovy dip, place the anchovies, lemon zest, garlic and cream into a blender and blend until smooth. Gradually add the olive oil until the sauce is thickened and emulsified. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve the piccalilli with the sliced ham, cheddar cheese and pork pie, the raw vegetables and the anchovy dip.
