Mix the potato and onion slices together in a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish and pour over the stock. Roast for 1-2 hours, or until the onions are soft and caramelised and the potatoes golden-brown.  For the stuffed baked apples and roasted shallots, preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Place the raisins and sultanas in a bowl. Add two tablespoons of calvados and leave to soak for a few minutes. After soaking, add the sugar, mixed spice, cinnamon and blanched hazelnuts. Spoon the fruit mixture into the centre of the cored apples, pressing in to fill well then drizzle the rest of the calvados over the apples. Place the apples and shallots on a large piece of aluminium foil and drizzle with a little oil.  Wrap the foil around the apples to create a parcel and bake for 20-30 minutes. For the pork chop, preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the pork chops and cook on each side for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to the oven for 5-8 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. To serve, place a pork chop on each plate and serve with the baked apples, shallots and potatoes. Drizzle over the jus and sprinkle the flatleaf parsley.
