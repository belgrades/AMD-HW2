When it starts to melt, add the nuts. Stir occasionally until the nuts are browned and the sugar is caramelised. Tip out carefully onto a sheet of silicone paper and allow to cool and set. For the rice pudding, heat the milk in a saucepan and when it is coming to the boil, add the rice and cook for five minutes. Split the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds. Add them to the pan along with the orange juice, maple syrup and cream and continue to cook until the rice is tender and cooked through.  Serve in a bowl garnished with orange segments, more maple syrup and cream drizzled over the top. Top with broken shards of pine nut brittle.
