If youâ€™re not using a barbecue, heat a griddle pan until hot. Tip the chickpeas into a bowl and crush to a thick paste with a potato masher. Stir in half the sweetcorn, onion powder, smoked paprika, lemon juice and plenty of salt and black pepper. Mix really well then add the gram or chickpea flour and mix really well again until the mixture starts to stick together. Divide the mixture into 4, then form each quarter into a burger shape. Brush the burgers with rapeseed oil and place on the barbecue or griddle. Cook on each side for 2 minutes until crisp and the burgers are hot all the way through. Split the buns and heat on the barbecue or griddle. Serve the burgers in the buns, topped with lettuce leaves and slices of tomato. Serve straightaway.
