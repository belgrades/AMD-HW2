Transfer the asparagus to a bowl and add the chopped herbs and a drizzle of olive oil. Stir well to coat, then spoon onto a serving plate and scatter over the grated cheese.  For the new potatoes, melt the butter and oil in a frying pan, add the potatoes, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown on all sides. For the poached egg, fill a small pan with boiling water and add the vinegar.
