Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle over the lemon zest and juice. Pour over the extra virgin olive oil and rub all over the meat. Leave to marinate for 2-3 hours turning once or twice. Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Place a heavy oven tray on the hob over a medium heat. Fry the lamb all over to colour and caramelize.  Place in the oven for around 40-50 minutes, or until just cooked through and still a little pink. Remove and rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a deep-fat fryer to 170C\/340F. Slice the artichokes into 3-4 slices each and dry thoroughly. Fry the artichokes for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Drain well and season with salt and pepper. For the pesto, put all the ingredients in a blender except the oil. Pulse to blend. With the motor running, slowly add the oil in a thin steady stream until you have a thick-ish green sauce that isn’t too smooth. Season well with salt, pepper and some lemon juice. Serve the lamb, thickly sliced with the pesto and artichokes on the side.
