For the pancakes, place the eggs, flour and milk into a bowl and mix together to make a batter the consistency of single cream.  Heat the vegetable oil in a small frying pan and remove the excess with kitchen paper. Add one tablespoonful of the pancake batter and swirl to coat the base of the pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side. Remove the pancake from the pan and repeat the process to make three more pancakes. For the soufflé filling, place the egg whites into a large, clean bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually whisk in the sugar one tablespoonful at a time until the mixture is glossy. Gently fold the fruit and crushed biscuits into the egg white mixture. Place a spoonful of the mixture onto each of the four pancakes. Fold each pancake to make a half moon shape, then place onto a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes. To serve, place the pancakes onto four plates and dust with icing sugar.
