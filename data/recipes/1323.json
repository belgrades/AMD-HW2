{"recipe_name":"Californian hot smoked salmon salad","author":"Simon Rimmer","programme":"Something for the Weekend","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/360F\/Gas 4. For the salmon, place the honey and soy sauce into a pan and bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until thickened and combined.  Brush the honey and soy sauce mixture onto the salmon fillets. Transfer to a baking tray and place into the oven for 5-6 minutes, to warm through. For the dressing, place the ginger into a piece of clean muslin and squeeze out the juice into a bowl. Add the mayonnaise, soy sauce, sugar and rice vinegar to the ginger juice and mix well. Add a little water if the mixture is too thick - it should be the consistency of double cream. For the salad, place the spinach leaves, tomatoes, pine nuts and spring onions into a large bowl and mix well. To serve, place equal amounts of salad mixture into four bowls. Spoon some of the dressing onto each portion and place a piece of salmon on top. Garnish with lime wedges and sprinkle with coriander leaves.
