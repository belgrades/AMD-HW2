Grease the insides of two ramekin dishes. For the soufflé, melt the butter in a small pan and stir in the flour to make a roux.  Place the chocolate into a bowl set over a pan of simmering water (make sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water surface) and leave to melt, about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Whip the egg whites in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gently fold the chocolate into the egg whites, followed by the roux. Spoon the soufflé mixture into the buttered ramekins and place onto a baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until well-risen.  Dust the soufflé with icing sugar and drizzle over the melted chocolate. Serve immediately.
