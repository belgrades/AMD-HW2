Place the tomatoes into a non-reactive baking dish and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle over the garlic and thyme. Drizzle over the oil and transfer to the oven to roast for one hour. Remove from the oven, drizzle the tomatoes with the vinegar, then set aside. For the tapenade, place the green olives, capers, lemon juice and garlic into a small blender and pulse to a rough paste. For the toast, brush the focaccia strips with olive oil, then place onto a very hot griddle pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until griddle lines appear on both sides.  To serve, place a strip of toast onto a plate and spread with a teaspoonful of tapenade. Repeat with the remaining toast strips until all of the tapenade is used up. Top each toast strip with a spoonful of tomatoes and finish with parmesan shavings.
