Top each biscuit with three strawberry halves, standing up on their hulled ends. Place the icing sugar, vanilla seeds and whipped cream into a bowl and fold together. Place a spoonful of the cream mixture on top of each of the strawberry layers. Place another shortbread biscuit on top of each layer of cream to create two sandwiches. For the coulis, place the strawberries and the champagne into a small food processor and blend to a smooth sauce. For the orange cream, place the cream and orange juice into a bowl and mix well. To serve, pour the coulis onto the plate around the strawberry shortbread stacks. Place small drops of the orange cream into the coulis around the strawberry shortbread stacks. Drag a toothpick or handle of a teaspoon through each drop of orange cream to create a decorative heart shape. Dust the strawberry shortbread stacks with icing sugar to serve.
