Place the chicken pieces into the marinade and cover with cling film. Leave to marinate in the fridge for at least an hour, preferably overnight. When you are ready to cook the chicken, prepare a barbecue grill, allowing the flames to die out before you begin cooking. Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and place straight onto the barbecue grill. Turn and baste them regularly with the marinade for about 40-50 minutes, or until completely cooked through and ready to serve.
