Press the fish into the seasoned flour to coat.  Heat the oil in a non-reactive frying pan over a high heat. Add the coated fish and fry for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the skin is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Remove the fish from the pan. For the balsamic sauce, add the balsamic and red wine vinegars to the fish pan and heat over a low heat for 2-3 minutes to deglaze, scraping up the bits from the pan with a wooden spoon. For the sautéed garlic and broccoli, heat the oil in a wok over a high heat, add the broccoli, garlic and chilli, and stir fry for 5-6 minutes. Stir in the parsley.  To serve, spoon the broccoli onto a plate, place the fish on top of the broccoli, and drizzle the balsamic sauce around the edge of the plate.
