Put them with all the other paste ingredients, except the oil, into a food processor and blend until smooth (it takes a good 5-10 minutes). Warm the oil in a pan and add four good spoonfuls of paste (one per person). Cook on a low heat until it becomes fragrant. Turn up the heat to high, add the coconut milk and stock and bring to the boil. Boil for three minutes. Add the French beans, marrow, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, courgettes and spring onions and simmer for about four minutes. While the curry is simmering, drain the rice.  Chop some coriander and stir through the rice, then pack into a small dome-shaped bowl. Turn the bowl upside down and remove to reveal a dome-shaped mound of rice. Garnish with finely sliced chilli and a sprig of coriander. Serve.
