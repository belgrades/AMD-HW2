Set aside a quarter of the cauliflower florets for the garnish. Cook the rest in boiling water or vegetable stock for about 10 minutes, until tender. Drain and reserve some of the cooking liquor to thin the soup later, if required. Cut the cauliflower reserved for garnish into tiny florets. Spread out in a single layer on a baking tray lined with aluminium foil and drizzle with oil. Roast for 15–20 minutes. Meanwhile, blend the boiled cauliflower in a food processor with the milk or cream (you may not need all the milk or cream if you like your soup thicker) until very smooth. Pour into a saucepan and season with salt and pepper. Add the butter and curry paste, stirring until it has melted and the soup is warmed through. If the soup is too thick, stir in some of the reserved cooking liquor. Remove the roasted cauliflower from the oven and mix with some chopped preserved lemon and a drizzle of olive oil. Pour the soup into warmed serving bowls and scatter over the roasted cauliflower mixture.
