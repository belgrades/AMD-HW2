Place in a pestle and mortar and grind until smooth.  Combine the spices with the rest of the dukkah ingredients in a bowl and mix until well combined.  Rub each lamb cutlet with the dukkah and orange juice mixture and grill on a hot griddle, on a barbecue, or under a pre-heated grill, for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.
