For the steak kebabs, soak two wooden skewers in a bowl of water for about 20 minutes, so that they don't burn during cooking. Thread the steak chunks onto the skewers and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then rub with oil. Heat a griddle pan until hot and sear the kebabs until golden-brown on all sides. Transfer to the oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. For the tomato chutney, heat the butter and oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 4-5 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, sugar, tomato purée and chopped tomato and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer gently for 6-8 minutes, or until the tomato starts to break down. Stir in the chopped herbs.  Serve the kebabs on a plate with the tomato chutney in a bowl on the side for dipping.
