Lay one sheet of ready-made filo on a non-stick baking sheet. Brush with the melted butter and then place another sheet of filo on top. Butter this sheet and repeat this layering until you have three layers of buttered filo sheets. For the filling, blend together the honey, fruit and nuts in a food processor to make a rough and chunky mixture. Spread the fruit and nut mixture over the filo layers. Top with a filo sheet, brush with melted butter and repeat the layering process as before using three sheets. Place into the preheated oven for ten minutes, until golden. Meanwhile, for the orange and honey sauce, heat the orange juice in a small saucepan with the honey and butter.
