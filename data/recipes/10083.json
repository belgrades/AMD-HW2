Beat the eggs with the milk. Pour this mixture over the sweetcorn and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Sieve the flour with the cayenne pepper and then stir into the sweetcorn. Add the oil to a large frying pan – you need to shallow fry these, so make sure the base of the pan is well covered. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Heat the oil then test by adding a tiny bit of the batter – it should immediately start bubbling around the edges when it hits the oil. Using a small ladle, drop batter onto the oil – you need around 2 tbsp of mixture per fritter. You should be able to fry 4-5 at any one time. Fry for a couple of minutes on one side until a light brown then turn over and cook for a further minute. Turn out onto kitchen towel to blot off any excess oil and keep warm. Continue until you have used up all the batter.
