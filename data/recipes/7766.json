Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the rice is cooked, stir in the clotted cream and leave to cool.  For the rhubarb compôte, melt the butter in a stainless steel pan before adding the chopped rhubarb, sugar and vanilla pod. Gently cook the rhubarb to a purée, stirring occasionally. Remove the vanilla pod from the purée, scraping the remaining vanilla seeds into the rhubarb before placing the purée  into a blender. Blend the mix thoroughly before passing through a fine sieve. Return the purée to a pan and keep warm. To serve, place a large spoon of the rice pudding into the middle of a large bowl. Make a well in the middle of the rice and spoon in some of the rhubarb compôte.
