Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Pat four apricot halves dry with kitchen paper and set aside. Chop the remaining apricots into small pieces.

Use a 8cm\/3in pastry cutter to press down lightly in the middle of each circle, then place on the baking tray. Brush the apricot jam in the smaller circle of each piece of pastry, then top each with an apricot half. Arrange the chopped apricots around the half, ensuring the pastry border is clear.
