For the dauphinoise potatoes, grease a medium-sized ovenproof dish with half the butter. Arrange the sliced potatoes in the dish in layers, with some garlic and seasoning in between the layers. Mix the milk and cream and pour over the potatoes. Dot the remaining butter over the top and cover with aluminium foil. Bake in the oven for 1½ hours. Remove the foil and return to the oven for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden-brown. For the spinach and basil timbale, grease six daroile moulds with butter and line with cling film. Line the moulds with the wilted spinach. Mix the bacon and croûtons in a bowl. Add the eggs and cream. Season with salt and pepper, add the parsley and pour into the moulds. Place the moulds in a deep-sided roasting tin and add boiling water to the tin until it comes half way up the side of the moulds.  Place in the oven for 30 minutes, or until set. For the herb crusted rack of lamb, preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Heat a large frying pan and add the oil, once hot, add the lamb and seal on all sides. In a bowl mix the breadcrumbs and herbs and set aside. Brush the lamb with mustard and then cover with the herb crumbs. Place the lamb back in the oven for 12-14 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Then remove and set aside to rest for at least five minutes before carving. To serve, carve the racks of lamb. Place a portion of potatoes and a timbale on each plate along with three pieces of the lamb. Serve with gravy.
