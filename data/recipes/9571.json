{"recipe_name":"Squid ink linguine with a crab, chilli and parsley sauce","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the linguine, put the flour, 2 egg yolks and the whole eggs in a large food processor. Add the squid ink and blend until the mixture resembles wet breadcrumbs. Squeeze a small amount in your hand to check if the dough comes together easily, if not add another egg yolk. (Make sure you remove the blade before placing your hand in the food processor.) Remove the mixture and turn out onto a floured work surface. Shape the dough into a ball and knead until smooth. Wrap in cling film and set aside to rest for at least 30 minutes. Remove the cling film and using a pasta machine roll out the dough, starting with the thickest setting and working down to the thinnest. Then feed through the linguine attachment, or cut into strips. For the crab, chilli and parsley sauce, heat a frying pan and, when hot, add the oil. Add the garlic and chilli and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the capers and fry for another minute. Pour in the white wine and cook for a further minute, then stir in the crab.  Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil and add the pasta. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. To serve, stir in the parsley, coriander, lemon (or lime) juice to the crab sauce. Add the pasta to the sauce and toss together, at this point you could add a touch of the pasta water to emulsify the sauce. Place in serving bowls and eat immediately.
