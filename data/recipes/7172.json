For the dauphinoise, grease an ovenproof dish with butter and place a layer of celeriac slices on the base.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle over a pinch of sage and a little cheese. Repeat layers of celeriac, sage and cheese until all the celeriac is used, setting aside a third of the cheese.  Combine the cream, milk and garlic and pour over the celeriac.  Top with the remaining cheese (and if you have time, allow to sit for 30 minutes for the cream to soak into the celeriac). Bake for an hour or until the vegetables are tender. For the pork, heat the butter in a pan, season the pork with salt and freshly ground black pepper and slice into 2.5cm\/1in slices. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and keep warm until you are ready to serve. To serve, cut out a round of the dauphinoise with a biscuit cutter and serve with the pork, fine green beans and apple chutney ","ingredients":" 1 head celeriac (about 400g\/14oz), peeled and thinly sliced,  butter, for greasing,  salt and freshly ground black pepper,  1 tbsp finely chopped sage,  100g\/3½oz mature cheddar cheese, grated,  150ml\/5fl oz double cream,  50ml\/2fl oz full-fat milk,  2 garlic cloves, crushed,  salt and freshly ground pepper,  75g\/2½oz butter,  2 x 200g\/7oz pork tenderloins,  salt and freshly ground black pepper,  fine beans ,  apple chutney","vegetarian":false,"calories":null,"protein":null,"carbs":null,"sugars":null,"total_fat":null,"saturated_fat":null,"fiber":null,"salt":null,"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/porktenderloinwithsa_84143"}
