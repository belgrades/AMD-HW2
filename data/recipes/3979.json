Cut each lemon sole or sole fillets into strips on the diagonal about 1cm\/½in thick. Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 190C\/375F. Coat the fish in flour, then the beaten egg and finally the crumbs; a few pieces at a time, making sure all the fish is coasted thoroughly. Place a few of the goujons in the fryer at a time and cook for about one minute, until crisp and golden brown.  Repeat until all the goujons are cooked. Once cooked, remove onto some kitchen paper to soak up the excess oil. For the tartare sauce mix together the mayonnaise, capers, gherkins and parsley and season. To make the salad dressing mix the lemon juice and olive oil together. Dress the mixed salad leaves with it. Pile the goujons in a dish or on plates, and serve with the wedges of lemon, tartare sauce and salad.
