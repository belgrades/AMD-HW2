{"recipe_name":"Sea bass with Chinese five-spice, lentils and mushroom fricassée","author":"Michael Caines","programme":"Spring Kitchen with Tom Kerridge","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"over 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the braised lentils, put the lentils in a saucepan and cover them with cold water. Bring to the boil, then take off the heat and drain in a colander. Refresh with cold water and drain again.  Return the lentils to the saucepan and add the vegetables, garlic, bouquet garni, stock, cinnamon stick and 2 litres\/3½ pints water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a slow simmer and cook for about three hours, or until the lentils are soft.  When the lentils are cooked, allow them to cool and then remove the bouquet garni and cinnamon stick. Strain off the liquid and return 250g\/9oz of the cooked lentils to the pan (any remaining lentils can be used in other dishes). Place over a medium high heat until any remaining liquid has evaporated. Add the chopped parsley and butter to finish, season with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.  For the roast sea bass with Chinese five-spice, take a sharp knife and carefully cut groves into the fish skin, taking care not to cut the flesh. Season with Chinese five-spice and rub into the skin. Season with salt and pepper and flour the skin-side only. Pat off the excess flour.  In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil and butter until foaming. Add the fish, skin-side down, and fry until the skin is crisp and the fish cooked through. If the fish is thick, reduce the heat and then place a lid on top to help it cook through.  For the mushroom fricassée, heat 20g\/¾oz butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, then add the shallot and a pinch of salt. When the shallots are soft and transparent, add the mushrooms and a squeeze of lemon juice and fry over a high heat for a minute or two. Add 30ml\/1fl oz of water and whisk in the remaining 40g\/1½ oz butter. Just before serving, add the tomato concass, herbs and season to taste with salt and pepper.  To serve, spoon some lentils onto the middle of each plate or bowl. Flip the fish in the pan and add a squeeze of lemon juice. Place the fish into the middle of the lentils and spoon over the mushrooms.
