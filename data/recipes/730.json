{"recipe_name":"Beef slices cooked with oloroso sherry","author":"José Pizarro","programme":"2007-16","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the olive oil mash, place the potatoes into a large saucepan and just cover with cold water. Add a pinch of salt, the garlic, bay leaves and two tablespoons of the olive oil, then bring the water to the boil. Reduce the heat until the liquid is simmering, then continue to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Drain well. Return the drained potatoes to the pan, then place the pan over the residual heat for a few seconds to drive off any excess moisture. Mash the potatoes until smooth using a potato masher or ricer. Stir in the olive oil until well combined, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Meanwhile, for the beef, season the strips of beef, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan or wok over a high heat until it is almost smoking. Add the garlic, beef strips and rosemary and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the beef has browned. Add the piquillo pepper slices and continue to stir-fry for a further minute, then pour in the sherry and boil for 2-3 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove the pan or wok from the heat, then stir in the chopped parsley and mint leaves.  To serve, divide the sliced lettuce leaves equally among four serving plates. Spoon over the beef, vegetables and cooking juices. Drizzle over a little more extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle over the flaked almonds and smoked paprika. Spoon the olive oil mash alongside.
