{"recipe_name":"Spatchcock pigeon on sourdough","author":"Theo Randall","programme":"Yes Chef","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Put the pigeons in a bowl and add the Marsala, half the garlic and the thyme. Cover and marinade in the fridge for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4.  Heat a little oil in a large, heavy-based, ovenproof frying pan and sear the pigeons for 1 minute on each side. Reserve the marinade. Turn them skin side-down and add the bread and pancetta to the pan. Transfer to the oven for 4 minutes.   Meanwhile, heat a splash of oil in another frying pan. Add the remaining garlic and cook briefly to soften. Add the porcini and fry for 3–4 minutes, or until just browning. Set aside in a warm place. Remove the pan from the oven and put the pigeons skin side-up on the bread. Return to the oven for 3 minutes. When the pigeons are cooked through, transfer to a chopping board (with the bread and pancetta), cover with foil and leave to rest. Reserve the cooking juices in the pan. Blanch the chard leaves in a pan of boiling salted water for 5 minutes, or until tender. Drain well, then dress with some good olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.   Pour the marinade into the frying pan used to cook the pigeons, bring to the boil and cook until reduced by half. Season with salt and pepper.  Meanwhile, cut each pigeon into two pieces at an angle so you have two legs on one half and the breast on the other. Put a slice of bread on each plate and spoon the porcini on the bread. Set the pieces of pigeon on top and add the chard and pancetta. Drizzle over the Marsala sauce.
