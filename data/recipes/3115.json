(CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)  For the batter, put the flour into a large bowl and gradually whisk in enough cold fizzy water to make a batter the onsistency of double cream.  Dip the sole into a little flour and shake off the excess and then dip into the batter. Then gently drop the battered fish into the hot oil. Deep fry for  five minutes or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the crisp noodles, carefully drop the rice noodles into the hot oil and fry for one minute or until puffed up. Remove with a slotted spoon and  drain on kitchen paper. For the brown butter sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan and heat until just turning golden-brown. Add the lemon juice and parsley, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for one more minute. To serve, pile the crisp noodles onto a serving plate, top with the deep fried sole and pour over the brown butter sauce and garnish with lemon wedges.
