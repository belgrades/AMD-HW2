To make the salad, drizzle one tablespoon of the olive oil over the rye bread and placeon the hot griddle pan. Griddle for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden-brown.  Spread one side of the rye bread with goats' cheese, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place under a hot grill for 2-3 minutes, or until beginning to turn golden-brown on top. Place the parsley leaves into a serving bowl and dress with the remaining one tablespoon of olive oil and the balsamic vinegar. Place the goats' cheese crostini on top. To make the aubergine crisps, pour the vegetable oil and olive oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Add the aubergine slices to the hot oil and fry gently for eight minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.  To serve, scatter the aubergine crisps with sea salt and scatter around the crostini in the serving bowl.
