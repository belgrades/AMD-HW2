Simmer for five minutes until the garlic is just softened. Take the pan off the heat and add the mustard, egg yolks and marinated anchovies, mixing to combine. Using a stick blender, blend to a pur√©e and transfer to a bowl. Gradually add the two oils, whisking constantly. Season with freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and set aside.  For the anchovies, preheat the grill to high. Season the anchovies with salt and freshly ground black pepper and brush with the olive oil. Mix the flour with the paprika in a small bowl and then toss the anchovies in the flour to coat. Place the anchovies onto a grill pan and place under the grill for two minutes until just cooked. Turn and cook for a further minute and then remove from the grill. For the salad, mix the country bread with the olive oil, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a frying pan until hot, add the bread and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden-brown on all sides and crunchy. Remove the pan from the heat, add the parmesan and mix to coat the croutons with parmesan. Place the Little Gem leaves and sliced anchovies into a bowl with some of the Caesar dressing and mix to coat. At the last minute, add the croutons and mix together. To serve, place a pile of salad in the centre of each of four plates. Pile up the grilled anchovies next to the salad and serve immediately.
