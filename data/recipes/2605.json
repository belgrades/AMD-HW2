{"recipe_name":"Coriander and tomato couscous with garlic grilled lamb, rosemary butter and roasted tomato sauce","author":"Richard Phillips","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. For the couscous, toast the couscous grains in a dry hot pan for 1-2 minutes, or until lightly golden, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning. Transfer the couscous to a bowl and add the vegetable stock. Cover with cling film and allow to soak for 5-7 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff up the grains with a fork and stir in the coriander and tomatoes. For the lamb cutlet, heat the oil in an ovenproof pan and add the lamb and garlic cloves. Cook the lamb for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until browned all over. Add the herbs to the pan, then transfer to the oven to cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the lamb is cooked to your liking.  For the rosemary butter, combine the butter and rosemary in a bowl and place in the fridge to chill before serving.  For the roasted tomato sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the tomatoes and garlic and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomatoes begin to burst. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, place a chefs' ring in the middle of a serving plate and pack in the couscous. Carefully remove the ring, then gently place the grilled lamb cutlet on top. Place a knob of the rosemary butter on top of the lamb, then spoon some of the tomato sauce around the edge of the plate.
