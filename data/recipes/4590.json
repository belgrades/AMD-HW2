Add the sugar, then whisk in the eggs and the milk, until you have a smooth batter, but don't over-mix it.  Heat a non-stick pan, melt a little butter in it and cook the pancakes - you need about 3 spoonfuls for each one. Cook until golden brown and turn over to colour the other side. Remove and place on a large plate and keep warm. Put the raspberries in a separate pan with the vanilla syrup and quickly but gently warm through. Pour the mixture over the pancakes and top with the vanilla ice cream.
