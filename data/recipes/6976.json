{"recipe_name":"Poached egg with toasted brioche and hazelnut-crumbed asparagus","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the asparagus, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the asparagus spears and cook for 1-2 minutes. Drain the asparagus and place into a bowl of ice cold water.  For the brioche crumb, put the brioche and hazelnuts in a food processor and blend until a crumb is formed. Heat a large frying pan and add the butter. Once melted, add the brioche and hazelnuts and toast until golden-brown. Stir in the maple syrup. Remove the asparagus from the water and drain on kitchen paper. Place the crumbs on a plate and roll the asparagus in the crumbs. For the poached eggs, bring a small pan of water to a gentle simmer and then add the vinegar. Stir the simmering water vigorously to create a vortex, and then carefully crack two of the eggs into the water. Poach for 2-3 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking, then carefully remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Repeat the process with the remaining two eggs. Alternatively, if using later, drop the poached eggs straight into iced water and chill in the fridge until ready to use. Bring a pan of water to the boil, then add the poached eggs and cook for one minute just to heat through. Drain on kitchen paper. To serve, divide the crumbed asparagus spears equally among four serving plates. Place one poached egg on top of each serving of asparagus.
