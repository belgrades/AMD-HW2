The oil is ready when you drop a breadcrumb in and it sizzles. (CAUTION: hot oil is dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep fry the tortilla triangles in the hot oil for 1-2 minutes, until crisp and golden. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. For the dip, mix the yoghurt, parsley and lemon juice in a bowl to combine. To serve, arrange the tortillas on a serving plate and serve the lemon dip on the side.
