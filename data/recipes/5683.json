{"recipe_name":"Microwave lemon drizzle cake","author":null,"programme":null,"prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Grease a 20x14cm\/8x5½in microwave-safe bowl with butter (a small ice cream tub will do) . Place the butter, flour and sugar in a bowl. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add the eggs and lemon zest and beat with a fork until you have a smooth batter.  Pour the cake mixture into the greased bowl and cover with cling film. Place into the microwave and cook on the highest power for four minutes, or until cooked through. You can test this by pulling back the cling film and piercing the cake with a skewer and removing it - if the skewer comes away clean then the cake is ready. Set the cake aside to cool, ideally on a wire rack. For the lemon icing, put the icing sugar and lemon juice into a bowl. Mix well until smooth. The icing should be thin enough to slowly run off the back of a spoon - if your lemon isn't very juicy you may need to add a little water to get the right consistency. To serve, place the cooled cake on a serving plate with the neatest side facing upwards. Drizzle over the lemon icing using a spoon. The cake is best eaten on the same day it's made.
