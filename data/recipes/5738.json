Weigh and measure all the ingredients.  Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 5. Oil a mini-muffin tray using the pastry brush and vegetable oil.   Break the egg into a bowl and beat it with the fork, then add the polenta.  This allows the polenta to soften slightly before cooking.   Ask a grown-up to help you to snip the spinach leaves into small pieces using scissors.  Add the cottage cheese, chilli powder and black pepper to the mixing bowl.  Then stir in the egg and polenta mixture. Sprinkle the plain flour over the mixture and stir again until it is thoroughly combined   Divide the mixture equally between the six parts of the muffin tin.  Bake for 12-15 minutes or until they are brown on top. Leave to cool. Serve one or two of these little savoury cakes with ham.
