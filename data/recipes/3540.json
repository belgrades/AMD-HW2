{"recipe_name":"Flambéed pears with pancakes and chocolate sauce","author":"James Tanner","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"less than 10 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Place all the pancake ingredients, apart from the oil, into a bowl and mix together to form a smooth batter. Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan over a high heat, and pour in enough batter to cover the base in a thin layer.   Cook the pancake for a minute or two, then carefully turn over when base is golden brown and cook the other side.  Cool.  Repeat until you have three pancakes.  Fold in half, then into quarters and stack onto a serving plate. For the chocolate sauce, place the chocolate and butter in a bowl (non-metallic) and place into the microwave. Cook for 30 seconds or until melted. For the pears, melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Add the brown sugar let dissolve, then add the pears. Add the liqueur and flambé, by lighting the liqueur with a match, taking care to keep the pan at arm's length (NB: keep a saucepan lid to the side in case the flame needs to be put out).  Shake the pan until the flame dies out.  To serve, stack the pancakes into the centre of a serving plate and place the pears on top.  Drizzle with the chocolate sauce and dust with icing sugar. Serve with a spoon of whipped cream if desired.
