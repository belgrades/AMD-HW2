{"recipe_name":"Roasted lamb, pickled squash and turnips with a chilli dressing","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2-4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the pickled vegetables, place the white wine vinegar, sugar and salt, and 110ml\/3½fl oz water in a small saucepan. Heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Put the vegetables in a bowl and pour over the pickling liquor. Set aside for 10 minutes then drain. For the chilli dressing, blend all the ingredients, except the caster sugar, to a smooth purée in a food processor. Heat the sugar in a heavy-based saucepan over a low heat until it forms a golden-brown caramel (CAUTION: boiling sugar is extremely hot. Handle very carefully. Use a deep pan to avoid bubbling over.). Do not stir. Keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t burn. Pour in the puréed chilli jam mixture and stir well. Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until sticky and jam-like. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. For the fillet of lamb, preheat the oven 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Heat a large oven-proof frying pan and add the oil. Once hot, add the lamb, season with salt and pepper and cook until coloured on all sides. Transfer to the oven for 10 minutes (or longer if you prefer your meat well-cooked). Remove from the oven when cooked and allow to rest for five minutes. Cut into strips. To serve mix the nuts, leaves and herbs in a large bowl and add the lamb and pickles. Dress the salad with the chilli dressing.
