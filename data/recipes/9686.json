Place the remaining ginger and spring onion into the fish cavity. Transfer the fish to a heatproof plate or dish and pour the rice wine over. Place the plate into a large bamboo steamer and cover. Place the bamboo steamer on top of a pan of boiling water (making sure the water does not touch the base of the steamer). Steam the fish for 8-10 minutes (depending on the size of the fish), or until the fish is cooked through (the flesh should flake easily when poked with chopsticks). Turn off the heat and leave the fish in the steamer to rest. For the sauce, heat a wok until smoking and add the oil. Add the grated ginger, stir-frying for a few seconds. Stir in the lime zest, followed by the beer and soy sauce. As soon as the liquid comes to the boil, add the spring onions and coriander, then remove from the heat. To serve, carefully remove the plate of fish from the bamboo steamer, pour the sauce over the fish and serve immediately with steamed wild basmati rice.
