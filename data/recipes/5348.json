Using your fingertips rub in the lard and butter until the mixture has the texture of breadcrumbs.  Stir in the sugar then gradually add the milk until a soft dough is formed. You may not need to use all the milk. Lightly knead the dough on a floured surface until a smooth dough is formed (this won’t take long).   Roll out the dough to a rectangle measuring 50x20cm\/20x8in.  Spread the jam over the dough. Roll the dough from the longest side as if rolling a Swiss roll. Bring the ends together and stick them together using a little milk. Shape the ring into a heart shape. Make small incisions over the surface of the heart shape. Brush the top with milk.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden-brown and the base is cooked through.
