Gradually whisk in the milk to make a smooth batter. Add the spring onions and grated potatoes to the batter and stir well. Heat half of the olive oil in a frying pan and remove the excess with kitchen paper. Pour in spoonfuls of the batter and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden-brown on both sides.

For the cream cheese topping, place the cream cheese, chives and parsley into a small bowl and mix well.
