Roughly chop the remaining pistachios with a sharp knife on a secure chopping board. Whisk the egg yolks with the other half of the sugar in a large, heatproof mixing bowl, until thick and creamy.  Place the cream and the finely ground pistachio and sugar mixture into a heavy-based pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Immediately remove from the heat and pour the mixture onto the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Return the pistachio custard to the pan and stir over a low heat until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and place into a large bowl of iced water to quickly cool, then refrigerate for at least one hour. Churn the pistachio custard in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Fold in the hand-chopped pistachios and transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container with a lid. Cover and freeze until required.
