Allow to cool. Boil the potatoes in their skins until soft, allow to cool slightly and peel. Crush the potatoes with a fork and add the wasabi, horseradish, yolks and chives, mix well and season. Heat a non-stick frying pan and lightly oil it. Spoon mixture into 4 oiled egg rings and cook over a moderate heat until golden brown, turn over and repeat. Heat a grill pan, brush the beef fillets with a little oil and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side and allow to rest in a warm place. Place a potato cake onto a warm dinner plate; slice the beef and place on top. Spoon the beetroot mix on top and drizzle some of the juice all around and serve.
