{"recipe_name":"Steak and fries with béarnaise sauce","author":"Glynn Purnell","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 2","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Marinade the steaks in the oil, black and pink peppercorns and the fennel seeds for up to half an hour. Preheat a griddle pan. Rub the steaks with oil and season with salt and pepper. When the griddle is very hot, cook the steaks on both sides for 2-3 minutes, then set aside and keep warm. Let them rest for the same amount of time as they were cooked. For the béarnaise sauce, place the vinegar, shallot, black peppercorns and stalks of the tarragon in a small saucepan with 2 tablespoons water and cook until it has reduced in volume by half. Strain and transfer to a food processor. Add the egg yolks and start to blend. With the motor running, gradually add the melted butter until you have a smooth sauce. Finish with the chopped tarragon leaves, salt and pepper. To make the chips, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan half full with vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 180C (use a probe thermometer to check the temperature if you're not using a deep-fat fryer). (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Don't leave unattended.) Pat the cut potato dry using a tea towel or kitchen paper. Carefully add the chips to the oil and deep-fry until cooked through (about 3 minutes). Set aside to drain on kitchen paper. To serve, cut the steaks into slices and serve with the fries and sauce.
