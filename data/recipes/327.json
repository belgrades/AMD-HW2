Halve and core the pears, then cut each pear into 12 small wedges.  Place in a heavy-based saucepan with the honey, port and wine.  Cook for 10-15 minutes or until the pears are tender to the point of a knife but not soft. Drain the liquid into a small pan and allow the pear wedges to drain thoroughly. Reduce the liquid by two thirds, when it should be a syrupy consistency, this will take 8-10 minutes.  Place in a small glass and allow to cool. To make the bruschettas, brush each slice of bread with the olive oil, and then grill until the bruschettas are golden on both sides.  This only takes a minute or two so keep a close eye! Just before your guests arrive, generously spread each bruschetta with gorgonzola, top with a poached pear slice.  Finally, using a teaspoon drizzle with the port syrup.
