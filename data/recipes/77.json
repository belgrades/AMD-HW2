Cook for 1-2 minutes, to soften but not brown. Add the anchovies and the wine and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, until the wine has reduced by half and the anchovies start to break down. Transfer the anchovy mixture to a food processor, add the egg yolk and cream and blend to a paste. Season with black pepper (the anchovies should make the dish salty enough) and pour into a serving bowl. Serve immediately with a selection of washed raw vegetables for dipping.
