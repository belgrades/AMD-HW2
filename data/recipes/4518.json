In a food processor, blend the flour and butter together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the sugar and salt to the food processor and pulse again until combined. In a small bowl, mix the egg with the cold water and gradually add enough liquid to the flour mixture to form a soft but not sticky dough. Place the dough onto a clean, lightly-floured surface and briefly knead the dough until smooth. With a clean, lightly-floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle shape 0.5cm\/¼in thick and trim the edges. Lay the pastry on a non-stick baking tray and sprinkle over the nuts, honey, rhubarb and caster sugar, leaving a border of pastry 1cm\/½in wide around the edges. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown. To serve, arrange the orange segments in a row down the centre of the tart and drizzle with the double cream.
