{"recipe_name":"Wild mushroom soup with homemade garlic bread","author":null,"programme":null,"prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the garlic bread, preheat the oven to 170C\/150C Fan\/Gas 3½. Wrap the garlic bulb in aluminium foil and place on a roasting tray. Roast for 40-45 minutes, or until soft. Leave to cool.  Cut the top off the garlic bulb and squeeze out all the soft cloves, then finely chop. Pour the cream into the bowl of a freestanding mixer and beat for 3-5 minutes, or until the mixture turns to solid fatty lumps with a liquid base. Line a colander with a clean muslin cloth and place it over a bowl. Tip the mixture into the colander and wrap the muslin tightly around the cream. Squeeze out all the liquid so that you have a solid mass of butter in the muslin, then discard the liquid. Tip the butter into a bowl, add the chopped garlic and a generous pinch of salt. Stir in the parsley and mix once more. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Meanwhile, for the soup, heat half the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until softened. Add 500g\/1lb 2oz of the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3-4 minutes.  Stir in the lemon juice, then the stock. Bring the boil, reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes.  Pour the soup into a blender and blend to a smooth purée. Return it to the pan and stir in the cream. Gently warm over a low heat, then stir in the butter, adjust the seasoning, if needed, and keep warm on the hob.  Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Gently fry the remaining mushrooms for 3 minutes, or until cooked, then season and set aside.  To serve, heat a large griddle pan and brush the bread with oil. Place on the griddle pan and cook each side for 1-2 minutes. Spread the bread with the garlic butter. Divide the cooked wild mushrooms between bowls, ladle over the soup and sprinkle with the chervil.
