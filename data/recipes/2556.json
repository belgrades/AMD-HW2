To make the stalks of the mushrooms, take four large and four small dariole mounds or vodka shot glasses, and line them with cling film. Fill with the slightly softened ice cream and re-freeze until set hard again.  To make the tuiles, cream the butter and sugar together.  Slowly add the egg whites to the mix, then fold in the flour.  Using one large and one small round template (margarine tub lids - cut a circle out of the lid and place on a baking tray, lipped side up and spread the tuile mix over the hole with a palette knife, then lift the template off to leave a perfect circle) - you will need 4 of each size.  Bake in the preheated oven for 2-3 minutes until lightly coloured at the edges.  Remove and place each disc of tuile over an egg cup or similar until cold.  The soft tuile will fold over into mushroom cap shapes and become crisp. Dissolving together the coffee and sugar with a very little boiling water to make a syrup. Stir the cooled coffee syrup into the double cream, making a coffee sauce.  To serve, scatter the gratings in a circle around the edges of four serving plates. Spoon some of the coffee sauce into the centre. Unmould the ice cream, removing the cling film, and stand the stalks upright on the pool of sauce, one of each size on each plate.  To make the mushroom caps turn the tuiles dome side up. Using a small sieve, dust the tuile domes with cocoa powder and icing sugar. Place the small caps on the small stalks and the large caps on the large stalks. Serve at once.
