Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based pan over a medium heat. Add the steak and fry in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown all over. Place the steak into a colander over a bowl to drain off any excess fat. Discard the collected fat. Add the onion and garlic to the same pan and fry until soft. Add the tomato purée and cook for six minutes. Add the chillies and cook for one minute. Add the canned tomatoes, coriander, cumin, cinnamon and the bay leaf. Return the meat to the pan and stir well. Simmer for 5-6 minutes. Add the beans and cook for 15 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir in the chocolate. Cut off the tops of the green peppers and scrape out the seeds. Level the bottom of each pepper with a knife to allow them to stand upright on a baking tray. Place the peppers into a pan of boiling water to blanch for three minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and plunge into a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process, then drain. Set half of the cheddar aside. Divide the other half of the cheddar equally among the peppers. Spoon chilli beef mixture into each pepper to fill to the brim. Top with equal amounts of the reserved grated cheddar and arrange, standing upright, onto a baking tray. Transfer to the oven and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place onto plates with a spoonful of rice alongside.
