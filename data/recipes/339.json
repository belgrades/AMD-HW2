Melt half the butter in a frying pan set over a medium heat. Gently fry the potatoes for about 6–8 minutes, or until they start to brown. Add the shallot and continue to fry gently for 3–4 minutes, it’s fine if they become a little coloured. Add the parsnip and apples. Allow everything to cook together over a low heat, tossing every 2 minutes or so, for 10–12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.  Meanwhile, heat a a griddle pan over a medium heat.  Lightly rub some olive oil into the bacon chops and season with salt and pepper. Cook the chops on the griddle pan for 3–4 minutes on each side until cooked and hot through, then set aside to rest on a wire rack. Melt the remaining butter in another frying pan and fry the eggs to your liking. To serve, finish the hash with a scattering of the sage, then divide between two serving plates. Put a chop on each and top with a fried egg.
