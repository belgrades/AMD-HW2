Simmer for 1-1½ hours until tender. Lift out the cooked octopus and set aside to cool a little, then slice into bite-sized pieces. For the salad, put all the ingredients into a large glass bowl and mix, season with salt and pepper. Mix in the octopus just before serving. For the salt and pepper squid, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Combine the cornflour and plain flour in a large bowl. Grind the sea salt and peppercorns to a powder in a pestle and mortar. Add the salt and pepper to the flours and mix. Dust the squid in the seasoned flours. Deep fry the squid for 1-2 minutes. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper until ready to serve. Serve the dishes separately with wedges of lemon and the aioli alongside in a small bowl.
