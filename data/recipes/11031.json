Heat until the whiskey starts to boil, then set aside to infuse for 1 hour. Put the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Add the butter and rub it in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the orange zest and the cherries, along with any whiskey that hasn’t been absorbed. Add the egg and cut it into the mixture using a knife – as soon as the mixture starts to come together as a dough, work it into a ball using your hands. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a thickness of about 5mm-1cm\/¼-½in. Using a 6cm\/2½in round cutter, cut out rounds of the dough. Reroll any leftover dough and repeat. The dough should yield around 20 cakes. Heat a flat griddle pan or heavy frying pan over a low-medium heat and lightly grease the surface with a little lard or butter. Cook the Welsh cakes in batches, for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until deep golden-brown and cooked through – do not have the heat too high or they will burn on the outside before they are cooked through. Cover a plate with caster sugar and coat the still hot Welsh cakes in the sugar. Serve warm or cold.
