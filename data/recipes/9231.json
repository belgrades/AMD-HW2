Thread two skewers across the poussin to hold it flat. Heat a griddle pan until smoking, place the poussin into the pan and cook for 6-7 minutes on each side, or until beginning to brown all over. Sprinkle over the herbs and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the poussin onto a baking sheet, transfer to the oven and bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden-brown and completely cooked through. (The juices should run clear when the poussin is pierced at the thickest point of the leg with a skewer.) For the spinach, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and spinach to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the spinach has wilted. For the roasted tomatoes, place the tomatoes onto a baking sheet, drizzle with oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 6-8 minutes. To serve, place the poussin onto a plate with the spinach and roasted tomatoes.
