{"recipe_name":"Onion tarte tatin with goats' cheese and balsamic glaze","author":"Curtis Stone","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 180 C\/350 F\/Gas 4. Peel the onions and slice into 2.5cm (1in) slices. Gently fry in a little butter over a medium-to-high heat until the onions begin to colour - approximately 3-5 minutes. Leave to cool. Wipe the remaining butter around the base of a clean, small, ovenproof frying pan and sprinkle the sugar over the butter. Place the cold, cooked onions on top of the sugar and butter in the pan. Cut a disc of puff pastry 2cm (¾in) larger in diameter than the pan containing the onions, butter and sugar.  Lay the pastry on top of the onions. The pastry should go up the side of the pan a little way, or over the edges to seal (this will depend on the height of your pan). Transfer the pan to the fridge and chill for one hour. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, reduce the balsamic vinegar over a medium-high heat to make a glaze. Remove the uncooked tart from the fridge and cook in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the pastry is cooked and golden. To turn out the tart, carefully place a plate over the pan and quickly turn the pan over (you may need to run a knife around the edge). The tart should be onion-side up, so the pastry has become the base. Place the slices of goats' cheese on top of the tart, and drizzle with the balsamic glaze.
