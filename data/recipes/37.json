Heat it very slowly, until almost at boiling point, then turn it down. Cook for around 30 minutes on a very low heat, stirring frequently to make sure it does not stick to the bottom. Meanwhile, make the cherry compôte. Put the cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, lemon juice and 300ml\/10 fl oz water. Heat slowly, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer for around 10 minutes until the cherries are slightly softened. Mix the arrowroot with a little water and stir until smooth. Add to the cherries as they are simmering and stir until the sauce has slightly thickened. Add the kirsch, if using.
