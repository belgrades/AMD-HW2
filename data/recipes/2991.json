{"recipe_name":"Curd tart with rose petal cream and redcurrants","author":"Nigel Haworth","programme":"Great British Menu","prep_time":"1-2 hours","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 160C\/325F\/Gas 2½. For the pastry, mix the plain flour, ground almonds and icing sugar together in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub together with your fingertips until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in half of the egg and knead to form a dough. Wrap the pastry in cling film and leave to rest for one hour. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface until it is 2mm thick. Lightly grease four small fluted loose-bottomed flan dishes, sprinkle with plain flour and shake out the excess flour. Line the prepared flan dishes with the pastry and trim the edges. Place in the fridge to chill for ten minutes. Prick the base of each pastry case with a fork, line with baking paper and fill with baking beans. Place on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the baking beans, brush with beaten egg and bake for five minutes or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely. For the filling, drain off any excess tea from the currants and set aside. Place the curd cheese, lemon zest and lemon juice in a non-reactive bowl and leave for one hour. Drain off any excess lemon juice from the curd cheese and carefully transfer the cheese into the pastry cases. Sprinkle the soaked currants over the curd cheese in the pastry cases. Place the eggs and sugar into a large bowl and whisk until pale and fluffy. Divide the sugary whisked egg mixture equally among the pastry cases, pouring over the curd and currants. Reduce the oven temperature to 150C\/300F\/Gas 2, place the tarts on a baking sheet and bake for 30-40 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature. For the rose petal cream, place the whipped cream into a large bowl, fold in the yoghurt and rosewater, and finally fold in the redcurrants. To serve, place one tart on each serving plate, place a spoonful of the cream on top, dust with icing sugar and serve.
