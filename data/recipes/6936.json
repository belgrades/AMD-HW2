Gradually add the water, mixing well to form a soft dough. Turn the dough out on to a floured work surface and knead for about five minutes, until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for about 1Â½ hours, until doubled in size. When the dough has risen, knock it back, then knead again until smooth, roll into a ball and set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour until risen again. Preheat the oven to its highest setting. Divide the dough into six balls and roll each out onto a lightly floured work surface until 20cm\/8in in diameter. Spread a little passata (or homemade tomato sauce) over each pizza base and top with your favourite toppings.  Bake the pizzas in the oven until the bases are crisp and golden-brown around the edges and any cheese on the topping has melted.
