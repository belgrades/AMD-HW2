Roll into a long sausage shape then cut into pieces to make gnudi.  Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and oil a baking tray. Poach the gnudi for a few minutes until they float to the surface. Drain well and put them on the baking tray. For the sauce, blanch the white asparagus in boiling salted water for a minute. Drain and leave to cool, slice diagonally into small pieces, then dress with some lemon juice, olive oil, seasoning and a little chopped tarragon. Set aside until you are ready to serve. Heat a large saucepan of boiling salted water and blanch the peas and broad beans for 1 minute. Cook the gnudi in a non-stick frying pan in a little butter until they start to become golden-brown. In a cold frying pan, add the pancetta and start to heat it to render out a little fat. Add a little drizzle of olive oil, and the wild garlic, broad beans and peas. Add a little knob of butter, a little lemon juice and cook gently. Add the gnudi and toss once. To serve, put the gnudi in pasta bowls with the sauce. Add the sliced white asparagus and finish with a sprinkle of wild garlic flowers, basil leaves, extra virgin olive oil and some Parmesan shavings.
