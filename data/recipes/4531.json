Season, to taste, with salt. Pour the red wine over the lamb shanks and set aside to marinate for at least one hour, preferably overnight in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 190C\/375F\/Gas 5. Place the casserole dish onto the hob over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Cover with a lid and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook for one hour, then remove the lid and cook for a further hour, or until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Remove the casserole dish from the oven and transfer the lamb shanks to a roasting tin. Spoon four ladlefuls of the sauce over the lamb shanks and add the red onion quarters.  Drizzle the honey over the lamb shanks. Return the dish, uncovered, to the oven and roast for 25-30 minutes, basting occasionally with the cooking liquid, until the meat comes away from the bone easily and the volume of cooking liquid has reduced by half. In a pan, mix the mashed potatoes with the lentils and warm through.  To serve, divide the mashed potatoes and lentils equally among four serving plates. Place the lamb shanks and the red onions alongside. Drizzle over the red wine sauce and garnish with a sprig of thyme.
