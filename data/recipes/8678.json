Gradually add the oil in a thin, steady stream until it is the consistency of mayonnaise. Add the harissa paste, lemon juice and tomato ketchup. Season with salt and pepper and mix again. Set aside.  For the seafood bourride, heat the fish soup in a large saucepan. Add the saffron and bring to a simmer. In a frying pan, heat the oil and cook the turbot on each side for 3–4 minutes. Half way through, add the scallop, squid and mullet to the pan and cook through. Turn the fish over half way through the cooking. Add the butter at the end and, once melted, use it to baste the fish. Place the cooked fish into the warm soup. For the sautéed spinach and chickpeas, while the fish is cooking heat a medium sauté pan and add the oil and butter. Once melted, add the spinach and chickpeas and cook until the spinach has wilted. To serve, put some spinach and chickpeas in the bottom of each serving bowl, place the fish on top and spoon over the soup. Sprinkle with the herbs and add a dollop of mayonnaise.
