Whisk in the milk slowly until you have a very thick sauce. Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in the breadcrumbs, both hams and parsley. Place in the fridge to chill for 3-4 hours. Shape the chilled mixture into 7cm\/2¾in cylinders. Place the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs in three separate bowls. Coat each one in the flour, then egg and finish with a layer of breadcrumbs.  Add the oil into a deep-fat fryer and preheat to 170C\/338F. (Caution: Do not leave hot oil unattended.) Deep fry the croquetas in batches until golden-brown. Remove and  drain on kitchen paper. To make the mayonnaise, whisk the egg yolks with the mustard in a bowl and then very slowly and gradually add the oil, whisking continuously. Stir through the vinegar and garlic, then season with salt and pepper. Serve the croquetas on a board with a bowl of mayonnaise for dipping.
