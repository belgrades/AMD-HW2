Add one tablespoon of the sugar and continue to whisk until the mixture comes back to stiff peaks. Keep adding sugar one tablespoon at a time until the meringue is thick and glossy. Mix the milk with 300ml\/10fl oz water and bring to a simmer in a pan with the salt, vanilla pod and seeds.  Using two large tablespoons or serving spoons dipped in cold water, shape the meringue into quenelles. Drop into the simmering milk. Cook for 4–5 minutes, turning over halfway through. Remove and place on a cooling rack or lined tray. For the crème anglaise, bring the milk to the boil with the vanilla pod. Remove from the heat, cover and leave to infuse for 5–10 minutes.  Beat the yolks with the sugar until thick and creamy. Bring the milk back to the boil and pour onto the yolk mixture, whisking continuously. Return to the saucepan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously with a spatula until it thickens slightly. Remove the pod and stir in the alcohol, if using. For the caramel flaked almond, put the sugar in a medium frying pan and cook until a soft caramel is formed. Toast the almonds in a pan until fragrant.  To serve, pour the crème anglaise into a serving bowl and float the meringues on top. Drizzle over the caramel and toasted almonds.
