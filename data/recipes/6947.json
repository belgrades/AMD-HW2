With the motor running, add the beaten egg and blend until the mixture starts to come together in a ball.  Shape the dough into a ball and flatten slightly. Roll the pastry out on a floured work surface, and using a 7.5cm\/3in cutter, cut out 12 rounds.  Use them to line a 12-hole muffin tin. Prick the base of the pastry with a fork, and freeze for one hour.  Pre-heat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Bake the pastry cases for 15-18 minutes, or until lightly browned and cooked through. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.  For the filling, coat the apple slices in lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Spoon a little mayonnaise into each pastry case and arrange small pieces of apple, cheese, celery, spring onion and tomato on top. Add half a teaspoon of pickle or chutney and garnish with a few celery leaves.
