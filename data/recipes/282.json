Cook for 1-2 minutes, just to warm through. Break the eggs into a bowl and break the yolks with a fork. Drain the cooked pasta and return to the pan it was cooked in. Retain a splash of the water the pasta was cooked in. Add the bacon and asparagus mixture, including any cooking oils from the pan. Toss well to combine over a low heat. Cook for one minute, then add the egg, parmesan and the reserved cooking water and cook for 30 seconds to one minute, stirring constantly, until the egg is just cooked. Add the chopped parsley and spoon equal portions into six bowls. Grate over a little extra parmesan and serve.
