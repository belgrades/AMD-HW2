{"recipe_name":"Lobster and roquefort gratin","author":"Michel Roux Jr.","programme":"Saturday Kitchen","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 8","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the lobster gratin, crack the lobsters open and carefully pick out all the meat. Slice into bite-sized morsels and set aside. Break up the shells with a rolling pin or mallet, place in the saucepan with half of the cream, add the brandy and wine and season will with salt and pepper. Simmer covered for 20 minutes, then strain though a fine sieve. Discard the shells, and whisk the cheese into the sauce. For the sabayon, put the butter into a small saucepan and bring slowly to a simmer. Skim the froth off the surface, then remove form the heat and leave to settle. Carefully pour the liquid butter into a bowl, taking care not to include any of the milky sediment.  Combine 4 tablespoons water with the vinegar and pepper in a small, thick-based saucepan. Boil over medium heat until reduced in volume by a third, leave to cool. Add the egg yolks and set over low heat, whisking continuously and ensuring that the whisk comes into contact with the entire bottom surface of the pan. The mixture should emulsify and become creamy in 8–10 minutes. Remove from the heat and slowly pour in the clarified butter, whisking vigorously. Check the seasoning, then strain though a fine sieve. For the watercress and spinach, heat a medium sauté pan and add the butter. Once melted add the watercress and spinach and cook until wilted down. To finish the lobster, heat a grill to high. Whip the remaining cream to soft peaks. Fold in the lobster sauce and sabayon. Do not over-mix or you will lose its lightness. Warm the lobster meat in a steamer or warm oven. Place in an ovenproof dish, cover with the sauce and immediately place under the grill. The sabayon and cheese will make the sauce glaze to a golden caramel colour.  Serve with the watercress and spinach alongside.
