{"recipe_name":" Herb-crumbed veal, potato rosti, chargrilled leeks, cabbage 'confit' and poached egg","author":"James Tanner","programme":"Ready Steady Cook","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Serves 1","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. For the herb-crumbed veal, place the herbs and breadcrumbs into a food processor and blend together, then place into a bowl. Place the beaten eggs in a separate bowl. Dredge the veal in seasoned flour and pat off any excess. Dip the veal in the beaten egg until coated all over, then dip again into the herbed breadcrumbs to coat. Repeat the egg and herb breadcrumb coating process. Heat the oil in a medium ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the breadcrumbed veal and fry for two minutes on each side, to brown all over. Transfer to the oven and roast for five minutes, or until the veal is cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave to rest. To make the potato rösti, heat half of the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the grated potatoes, seasoning well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sauté, without turning, until golden. Add the other half of the butter to the pan and carefully turn over the rösti and cook the other side until golden. To make the cabbage, heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the shredded cabbage and red wine and cook for three minutes.  Add the sugar and cook, stirring well, for two minutes. Add the chicken stock, bring to the boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the cabbage has softened. To make the poached egg, place the water and vinegar in a saucepan and heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Swirl the water with a spoon to create a whirlpool effect. Gently add the egg and poach for three minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Remove with a slotted spoon and rinse with hot water. To serve, place the rösti in the centre of a warm plate, place the breadcrumbed veal on top. Serve some of the cabbage alongside and top with the poached egg.
