{"recipe_name":"Goats’ cheese on brioche with salt baked celeriac and red currant dressing","author":"James Martin","programme":"Saturday Kitchen Best Bites","prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"30 mins to 1 hour","serves":"Serves 4","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"For the dressing, place the redcurrant jelly, vinegar and cloves into a saucepan and cook until reduced in volume down to a glaze thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Pass the mixture through a sieve into a clean bowl, whisk in the mustard then set aside. For the salad, preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6. Whisk the egg whites until soft peaks then fold in the salt. Place a spoonful onto a baking tray then place the celeriac on top and cover with the rest of the salt. Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes then leave to rest for five minutes. Crack the egg coating and remove the celeriac, discarding the salt. Peel the celeriac and thinly slice then stamp out discs with a cutter and set aside. Place the crumbled goats’ cheese into a bowl with the double cream and whip until softened and combined. Season with a little salt and plenty of black pepper. Toast the brioche until coloured a light golden-brown. Mix the lettuce leaves with the firm goats’ cheese in a bowl. Whisk the vinegar, olive oil and lemon juice together then dress the salad leaves lightly with the dressing. To serve, place the discs of celeriac into the red currant dressing and toss to combine. Place a few discs on the centre of the plate. Top with the brioche toast and a quenelle of the cream and goats’ cheese mix. Finish with a little tower of salad and serve immediately.
