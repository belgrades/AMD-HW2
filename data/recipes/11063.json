Melt carefully, stirring occasionally.  Line a tray with baking paper. Pour the chocolate on top and spread out to a rectangle about 20x18cm\/8x7in. Allow to cool and set. Cut 12 rectangular pieces, each about 10x3cm\/4x1¼in. Melt the remaining white chocolate as above. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, whip the cream in a mixing bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Quickly fold in the remaining melted white chocolate using a large metal spoon. To build the millefeuilles, put six of the white chocolate rectangles onto a tray. Top each with a spoonful of the white chocolate cream. Place another chocolate rectangle over and press gently. Spoon over another spoonful of the cream. Top with a few raspberries and spoon the remaining cream over them. Place the last rectangle on top, pressing gently again. Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately.
