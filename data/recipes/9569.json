Leave to infuse for a few hours. Sieve the sauce and reheat before serving. For the confit tomato petals, preheat the oven to 110C\/225F\/Gas ¼. Cut the flesh from the sides of the tomatoes to make twelve rounded petal shapes. Place the tomato petals on a baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook for one hour. Remove and set aside For the rice, in a frying pan heat the duck fat and beef marrow, add the shallot and fry gently without colouring.  Add the rice then pour in the wine and cook for two minutes. Add the chicken stock until it just covers the rice. Once the stock is absorbed, little by little, add more stock until the rice is cooked (about 20 minutes). Season with salt, pepper and Espelette chilli, add the squid ink, then stir in the whipping cream.  Season the squid with salt. Heat the duck fat in a frying pan and fry the squid gently.   Add the chorizo and cook for a few minutes. Add 12 confit tomato petals and parsley.  Add the lemon juice and white stock to the pan and deglaze (scraping the cooked on parts from the bottom of the pan). Heat to reduce for a minute, then mix in the butter and the olive oil.  Place a spoonful of the rice in the centre of the plate and top with the squid mix. Place a hand blender in the emulsion and blend until foam appears. Dress the dish with the foam.
