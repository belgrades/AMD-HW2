Using a large knife or kitchen scissors, cut the poussins in half following the line of the backbone and the breastbone.  Flatten out both halves, moving the legs away from the breast, and place onto a dish. Score the flesh of the legs to the bone. Place the cardamom seeds, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, black pepper, curry powder, turmeric, and salt to a mortar and pestle.  Crush together to a coarse powder.  Add the finely chopped garlic and mix everything together. Transfer the mixture into a bowl, add the lemon juice and oil and blend together well.  Work the mixture into the poussins making sure it goes into the cuts. Leave the poussins to marinate for up to an hour.  Melt a knob of butter in a frying pan and gently fry the poussins over a low heat. Be careful not to burn the spices. Use a spoon to coat the poussins with the spices and butter.    Transfer to an oven tray and place in the oven to cook for 10-12 minutes. The birds are cooked when the juices run clear when the leg is skewered at the thickest part. Once cooked, sprinkle with toasted almonds and serve with flatbreads and raita.
