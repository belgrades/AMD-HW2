To make the pork escalope, place 3 of the basil leaves on the flattened pork, place the brie on top of the leaves and cover with the other 3 leaves. Roll the pork around the brie and basil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Wrap tightly in clingfilm and refrigerate for five minutes.  Unwrap the pork and discard the clingfilm. Roll the pork in the flour, then in the beaten eggs and then in the breadcrumbs. Squeeze the pork gently with your hands to secure the breadcrumbs.  Heat a dash of olive oil in a frying pan and fry the pork for two minutes on each side, then roast in the oven for ten minutes or until completely cooked through. Remove from the oven and slice in half on the diagonal. To make the fondant potatoes, put all the ingredients except the potato in a ovenproof frying pan and heat until the butter has melted and is starting to foam. Add the potato rounds and fry on each side for two minutes, then place in the oven to roast for fifteen minutes. Remove from the oven, drain on kitchen towels and keep warm until needed. To make the wild mushroom sauce, melt the butter in a small frying pan. Add the garlic and onion and sauté gently until softened. Add the mushrooms, cream, salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook gently for 5 minutes. To serve, pour the mushroom sauce onto a plate, place the pork escalope on top and serve with the fondant potatoes.
