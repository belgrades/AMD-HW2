Half fill a thick-based pan with the vegetable oil and heat until a cube of bread dropped in sizzles and turns golden-brown in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the parsnip wedges, in batches, in the hot oil for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.  For the rösti, place the grated potato into a clean tea towel and squeeze out the excess moisture. Heat the oil and butter in a small frying pan and fry the potato for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown underneath. Carefully turn the rösti and fry for a further 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown all over.  Serve the potato rösti alongside the parsnip chips.
