Lay a double layer of kitchen paper on a chopping board, and place the colander on top to absorb any excess liquid from the tofu. Leave for about 10-15 minutes. After the tofu has been left to drain, cut each piece in half horizontally to make thin 'steaks'. Dredge the tofu in the seasoned flour, coating it on all sides. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and add each steak to the pan when the oil is gently sizzling. Gently fry the tofu until golden-brown all over. Transfer the tofu steaks to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain any excess oil. Add the butter to the pan. As soon as the butter has melted, add the soy sauce and rice syrup. When it starts to thicken slightly, remove from the heat and pour over the steaks. Scatter over the chopped coriander, add a squeeze of lemon juice and serve immediately.
