Strain through a fine or muslin-lined sieve. If not using immediately, leave to cool, then refrigerate or freeze. For the arroz verde, heat the oil in a 28–30cm\/11–12in shallow flameproof casserole over medium heat. Add the shallots and fry for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and fry for 40–60 seconds, then stir in the fish stock, parsley and salt and bring to the boil. Sprinkle in the rice, stir once, then leave to simmer vigorously over medium–high heat for 6 minutes. Put the clams and prawns on top and shake the pan briefly so they sink into the rice a little. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 12 minutes. Almost all the liquid should be absorbed and the rice should be pitted with small holes. Discard any clams that do not open after cooking. Meanwhile, for the aioli, mix the garlic and salt together to form a paste. Put in a food processor and add the yolk. Turn on the machine and very slowly trickle the oil through the hole in the lid until you have a thick emulsion.  Serve the arroz verde with the aioli.
