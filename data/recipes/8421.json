For the pork, rub the pork with olive oil and season on both sides with sea salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Heat an ovenproof frying pan and cook the pork over a high heat, turning frequently, until golden-brown on all sides. Transfer to the oven for ten minutes, or until completely cooked through.  Remove the pork from the pan and rest on a plate. Add the wine to the frying pan and place over a medium heat. Scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Add the lemon juice and whisk in the butter. Set aside in a warm place. For the potatoes, boil the potato pieces in a saucepan of salted water for 6-8 minutes, or until tender. Drain and return to the pan. Season the potato with salt and freshly ground black pepper, add the olive oil and mash roughly with a potato masher. Stir in the parsley and set aside to keep warm. For the pea purée, blanch the peas in a saucepan of boiling water for 3-4 minutes. Drain and return to the pan. Add the cream, mustard and curry powder and use a mini-blender to blend until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To serve, slice the pork into 2-3 pieces, serve on a pile of crushed potatoes and pour over the pan juices. Drizzle the edge of the plate with the pea purée.
