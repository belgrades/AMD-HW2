{"recipe_name":"Baked creamy rice pudding","author":null,"programme":null,"prep_time":"less than 30 mins","cooking_time":"1 to 2 hours","serves":"Serves 4-6","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Preheat the oven to 150C\/300F\/Gas 2 and grease a 1.5 litre\/2½ pint ovenproof dish with a little butter. Rinse the rice under cold water and place in the ovenproof dish. Place the cream, milk, caster sugar and a generous grating of nutmeg in a medium saucepan. Scrape in the seeds of the vanilla pod, if using. Heat gently until almost simmering, then remove from the heat and pour over the rice, stirring well. Dot the butter over the top and place in the oven for 1½ hours, stirring after the first 30 minutes (at this stage, you can add an extra grating of nutmeg, if liked). If the pudding still seems very runny, return to the oven, checking every 10 minutes, until it is loosely creamy but not runny. The cooking time will vary, depending on the type and depth of dish you use. When the pudding is golden brown on top and has a soft, creamy texture, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
