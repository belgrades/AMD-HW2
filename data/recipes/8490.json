Chop the sausage meat up and place in a bowl. Add the soy sauce, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and Stilton and mix well. Transfer into an ovenproof dish and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked and golden. For the rösti, mix the carrot and potato together in a clean bowl. Squeeze out in a clean tea towel to get rid of any excess moisture. Melt the butter in a small frying pan and press the potato and carrot mixture into the pan to flatten slightly. Fry for five minutes on each side, until cooked through and golden all over. Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and crack in the egg. Fry until the egg white has set but the yolk is still runny, or accorning to your taste. Serve the rösti in the centre of a plate, top with the sausage mixture and place the fried egg on top.
