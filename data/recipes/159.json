{"recipe_name":"Apple, date and ginger chutney","author":"Jo' Pratt","programme":"The Nation's Favourite Food","prep_time":"over 2 hours","cooking_time":"10 to 30 mins","serves":"Makes 1.5 litres\/2½ pint","pic_url":"http:\/\/www.ballesteros.me\/amd\/unknown.png","method":"Peel, core and thinly slice the apples. Place in a large pan with the garlic and vinegar. Cook gently until the apples have broken down into a thick purée. Stir in the sugar, dates, sultanas, ginger, salt and spices. Cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Spoon into hot, sterilised, glass preserving jars with clip tops. To enjoy the chutney at its best, store in a cool, dark, dry place for about 2-3 weeks before eating. This allows time for the flavours to mature. Once a jar has been opened, store in the fridge and eat within 1 month.
