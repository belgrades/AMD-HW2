Drain well, return to the saucepan and mash until smooth. Leave to cool slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the grill to medium-hot. Lay the bacon rashers on a foil-lined grill pan and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until slightly crispy. Season the tomatoes with salt and freshly ground black pepper and grill until soft. Keep warm.  Beat the baking powder into the mashed potato, then the eggs and milk. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Continue to beat until everything is evenly combined. Heat a little oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Drop heaped dessertspoons of the mixture into the pan, spacing them slightly apart, and fry for 3-4 minutes, turning once, until golden-brown. Transfer to a serving plate and keep warm while frying the remainder of the potato mixture.  Divide the scones between four plates, topping each plate with two rashers and two tomato halves.
