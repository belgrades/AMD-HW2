Cut the pork into large cubes and thread onto skewers, alternating with the onion and peppers.  Drizzle with olive oil and cook on the griddle, turning every few minutes to ensure even cooking.  Just before the souvlakia are fully cooked, drizzle the red wine over them (while still on the griddle).  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle with oregano.  Once the souvlakia are cooked, remove them from the griddle and serve in pittas with salad such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, onions and a dollop of chilli sauce.
