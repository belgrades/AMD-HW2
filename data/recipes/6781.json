Add the sliced red and yellow pepper to the pan and allow to soften for 2-3 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for a further two minutes, gently squashing the tomatoes with a wooden spoon to release their juices. Mix in the harissa paste. Carefully pour the chickpeas, and the water in which they were stored, into the pan.  Stir, then allow them to heat through thoroughly for 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and the juice of half a lemon. Add a handful of fresh basil leaves right at the end of cooking, so they wilt under the residual heat. Serve immediately.
